An author could be one who pushes substantial contributions or those that regularly answer questions. The key is for these to be sustained expertise contributions. The author order will be alphabetical and an author cannot be removed from the list. We will also support an author section in the specification appendix that can specifically identify their contributions to the project. This can include contributors too. The author section may include the potential for a paragraph (max) narrative of contributions. This will be enhancing our current emoji representation of contributions.

Will there be a hybrid option?</p> <p>Current suggestions (Cyril), have people come with data and complete examples to improve BEPS</p> <p>Stefan:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Amendment 1 - every BEP lead will join the BIDS advisory group     forever (not ideal), proposed to allow individuals to leave the     advisory group after 2 years and asked to suggest a replacement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amendment 2 - we don't currently have a process to change the BIDS     governance,     some solutions have been put forth</p> </li> <li> <p>Amendment 3 - BIDS contributors - governance states that all     contributors are equal, but this needs to be amended because many     contributors at some point are no longer active and this creates issues     when minimum % of votes are required for certain elections. WIP for     current and new wording - maintainers are working on this and the     steering group can comment and give feedback.</p> </li> </ul> <p>GUIO: Suggestion to include a list of Advisory Group members.</p> <p>Robert: What is the order of amendments to be approved?</p> <p>Stefan - suggests all amendments to be at once. This has been done before, there is precedence.</p> <p>Yaroslav: recommends new language to define active &amp; inactive advisory group members.</p> <p>Chris Rorden also got in touch with the DICOM working groups - its a good idea, however its possibly beyond the expertise of individuals in the steering group and beyond the time constraints of the BIDS steering group.</p> <p>Alignment with BIDS and DICOM should be encouraged, but time is the obstacle for working with DICOMs. Maybe DICOM working group 16 may be worthwhile to interact with to inform/influence their decision making to align with BIDS.</p> <p>Can Chris facilitate this with working group 16? Perhaps Yarik can voice steering group issues with guidance from Chris (who is likely most familiar with issues between DICOM and BIDS).</p> <p>ACTION: email DICOM and present BIDS to them with support form Chris.</p> <p>DICOM meeting notes</p> <p>Cyril: discussed with aperture on submitting data papers (including a logo to indicate the dataset is BIDS compliant). data must be BIDS validated, it must include a sharing statement, if its not on openneuro then there must be a way to ensure it is BIDS validated.

However the use of BIDS tools can facilitate this.</p> <p>Guy: Some fields have tools that produce a \"validation receipt\" that demonstrates the validity of the dataset. A printout of the validator could do that.</p> <p>BIDS validator could be used, however the validator outputs are not consistent. Scientific data could provide different levels (A,B,C grading) to indicate if a dataset has certain BIDS errors or is missing necessary metadata or files. For example datasets on OpenNeuro may be in BIDS but may still contain errors.</p> <p>If OpenNeuro mandated that all datasets be BIDS compliant, then that could be one route for ensuring validity.</p> <p>Scientific Data could consider a trial where the authors required a certificate of compliance. This could be an option (check box) during the manuscript submission period. This could be the easiest, but may not be a perfect solution because it\\'s based on the user.</p> <p>For other data modalities (for example genetics, and so on), typically the journal just encourages it to be shared on a repository. There are not many efforts like BIDS, for standards themselves.</p> <p>Nature Neuro may be another target journal that Guy could connect us with to expand this mechanism.</p> <p>ACTION ITEM: add a button that produces a PDF of the BIDS validation results.</p> <p>Should this PDF include a file listing to make sure that the dataset has not been altered.</p> <p>Add a list of BIDS ignore files:</p> <p>https://github.com/bids-standard/legacy-validator/issues/1676</p> <p>https://github.com/bids-standard/legacy-validator/issues/1677</p> <p>Should we reach out to the new Imaging Neuroscience journal while they are still developing their platform?</p> <p>Potentially reach out to someone on their editorial board</p> <ul> <li>possible Thomas Yeo, Damian Fair</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2023/05/25/Steering%20Group%20minutes.html#nsf-pose-workshop","title":"NSF POSE WORKSHOP","text":"<p>A funding mechanism for conferences and workshops.

And should these comments be evaluated by the BEP lead?</p> </li> <li> <p>FP: Historically the BEP lead made those higher level decisions of which comments to address.     However these BEPs had a larger group of contributors and did not always have a strong, single lead to make those decisions.     It also was not clear how quickly comments should be resolved, this became problematic where comments were not very clear.</p> </li> <li> <p>DH: The assumption has been that comments could be resolved by the BEP lead, should this be outlined somewhere more clearly?</p> </li> <li> <p>AR: We can use prior experience to more clearly outline what is a BEP lead supposed to do based on previous BEP successes and struggles.     We should designate where work should be organized (which github accounts for making PRs, google docs and so on).</p> </li> <li> <p>FP: we need to write down the timeline rules, be clear that all BIDS contributions should be kept in the BIDS github.</p> </li> <li> <p>YH: comments are difficult to manage, there are often social aspects to PRs as well.     Perhaps large BEPs should require all changes be implemented via PR.     Regarding grant timelines - perhaps these BEPS should have stronger leadership to push progress     in order to maintain their established timeline (as much as allowable),     adding more formal outlines of how contributors should interact could help with this.     Maybe add a \"reminder bot\" that pings PRs/Issues after N weeks of no discussion     to say something like \"Seems like the discussion has ended? Does anyone want to add anything or should we close this?\"</p> </li> <li> <p>CM: most BEPs aren't grant supported, but it sounds like having a more explicit guide for leading BEPs would be beneficial for all BEPS moving forward.     Responding to DH, who recalled reaching out to BIDS maintained for support when the BEP lead was not able to resolve a comment,     this should be an added suggested for addressing complex PRs/issues/comments.     Suggestion to write best practices on how to send/express comments.     And guidelines on how/when to reach out to leadership (steering/maintainers).</p> </li> <li> <p>DH: In some cases, the same issues are reiterated in multiple threads, this can be difficult to follow.     Would we need guidelines for this as well? for example: the inheritance principle in BIDS 2.0.</p> </li> <li> <p>AR: There are timelines in the BEP process for community review.     The connectivity might have run into further issues because certain BEPs are not yet complete (don't have schema, examples),     this should be the responsibility of the BEP lead to urge progress.     Suggestion: outline this in the grant proposal.</p> </li> <li> <p>CM: suggests open a working group to establish the role of the BEP lead.

Chris directs 2i2c, and has a unique perspective on these issues. He's also a BIDS contributor, having worked extensively on the iEEG BEP and related.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: What was the funding model that worked best for 2i2c?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: Their funding comes froma small number of large scale contracts, they use jupyiter hub as a base unit for funding.     University bureaucracy was not an ideal route for funding services or individuals     \"Fiscal sponsors\": cost/benefit tradeoffs.     On the expensive side, we might be looking at 15% overhead and would provide a high degree of \"service\" for this.     Can expect contracts administered on time by these entities.     There will still be a governance and execution problem unless they identify an 'executive office'     (executive director) to make the decisions for BIDS, ensure progress and direction.</p> </li> <li> <p>AR: membership fees could be a possibly source of funds, funds could also come from grants.     There is a set of governing bodies (steering group and maintainers).     What would be the labor to bootstrap/kickstart the engine to move any funding model (membership/ service/ grant) forward?     What goes into creating a non-profit?</p> </li> <li> <p>CH: 2i2c is a nonprofit but has a fiscal sponsor, this did not require them to go through the legal process.     The fiscal sponsor is the 501c3 non-profit organization, and they provide the services to 2i2c.     They set up a contract based service relationship outlining the expectations for the organizaiton and for the fiscal sponsor.     Code for science and society (2i2c's fiscal sponsor).</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Who drew up the contracts? 2i2c likely used a standard fiscal sponsorship contract.     This included stating the organization mission and intention.     It comes down to if there are rules that need to exist that are dedicated to the BIDS community?     Sometimes bringing financial relationships into the mix can hurt the larger community.     This may or may not be true for BIDS, but something to consider.</p> </li> <li> <p>AR: Project management is an important role BIDS needs to fill</p> </li> <li> <p>CH: agreed, and product management could also be a valuable role or need for BIDS.

By using Javascript and hosting a web app that ran entirely in the user's browser, we were able to achieve this goal without requiring users to install anything. This decision was crucial to the success of the validator, which in turn was crucial to the success of BIDS.</p> <p>This decision came at a cost, however. While programming expertise and open source development are prevalent and valued in the neuroimaging community, most of that expertise is in Python, R and MATLAB (and to some extent C/C++), and relatively few researchers have much experience with Javascript. As a result, as BIDS grew with BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs), updating the validator to support the new data types and enforce the new rules became a consistent bottleneck.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/13/bids-validator-2.html#the-bids-schema","title":"The BIDS Schema","text":"<p>In the summer of 2021, the BIDS Steering Group approved the development of the BIDS Schema, a project to encode as much of the BIDS Standard as possible in declarative, machine-readable rules, and to rewrite the validator to use the schema to enforce the rules.

Through my work on the BIDS Connectivity Project, we have advanced the development of six BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs), contributing to crucial updates in BIDS governance principles.     These efforts will help BIDS remain relevant and applicable as new methodologies and technologies emerge.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expanding Beyond Neuroimaging: BIDS has enormous potential to benefit other scientific communities beyond neuroimaging.     My involvement in developing new data types for U.S.-based efforts has shown that BIDS could be adapted for broader scientific applications, especially as we move toward BIDS 2.0, incorporating automation and AI.     By doing so, we can extend the BIDS framework to support an even more diverse range of data and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I have also led efforts to secure funding to support BIDS initiatives and create tools, such as ezBIDS on brainlife.io (widely used for data standardization across the U.S., Africa, and Europe).</p> <p>I would look forward to contributing to the growth of BIDS, ensuring it remains adaptable and beneficial to a global scientific community. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to participate in shaping the future vision of BIDS, including BIDS 2.0 and its applications in automation and AI.</p> <p>Thanks to all contributors for your participation, and congratulations to Franco!</p>"},{"location":"blog/2020/06/19/BIDS%20at%20OHBM%202020.html","title":"Town hall 2020","text":"<p>Check out the wide range of ways BIDS is being implemented throughout the field!</p>"},{"location":"blog/2020/06/19/BIDS%20at%20OHBM%202020.html#posters-at-ohbm","title":"Posters at OHBM","text":""},{"location":"blog/2020/06/19/BIDS%20at%20OHBM%202020.html#category-modeling-and-analysis-methods","title":"Category: Modeling and Analysis Methods","text":"<p>Poster 1340: Confounder: A BIDS app for assessing the influence of experimental confounds in task-based GLM model presented by Suzanne Witt</p>"},{"location":"blog/2020/06/19/BIDS%20at%20OHBM%202020.html#category-neuroinformatics-and-data-sharing","title":"Category: Neuroinformatics and Data Sharing","text":"<p>Poster 1895: BIDS Derivatives - Standardization of Processing Results in Brain Imaging presented presented by Chris Markiewicz</p> <p>Poster 1907: A standard for the organization of quantitative MRI data: BIDS extension proposal 001 presented by Gilles de Hollander</p> <p>Poster 1918: Framework for performing multi-subject analysis in electrophysiology within the BIDS format presented by Aude Jegou</p> <p>Poster 1936: R-BIDS, a DICOM conversion and BIDS data structuring workflow developed in R presented by Niklas Wulms</p> <p>Poster 1940: MNE-BIDS: Standardizing archiving and analysis of electrophysiology data with MNE presented by Alexandre Gramfort</p> <p>Poster 1941: A system for automatic BIDS conversion from the Siemens console in Flywheel presented by Timothy Verstynen</p> <p>Poster 1956: Physiopy/phys2bids: BIDS formatting of physiological recordings presented by Stefano Moia</p> <p>Poster 1966: EzBIDS: The open cloud service for automated, validated DICOM to BIDS conversion presented by Daniel Levitas</p> <p>Poster 1984: OmniiBIDS: Automatic Conversion of Structured NIfTI Datasets to BIDS presented by Alexandre Hutton</p>"},{"location":"blog/2020/06/19/BIDS%20at%20OHBM%202020.html#talks-in-the-open-science-room","title":"Talks in the Open Science Room","text":""},{"location":"blog/2020/06/19/BIDS%20at%20OHBM%202020.html#tuesday-june-23","title":"Tuesday, June 23","text":""},{"location":"blog/2020/06/19/BIDS%20at%20OHBM%202020.html#open-data-20-lighting-talk-section","title":"Open Data 2.0 Lighting talk section","text":"<p>Concept Annotations via NIDM-Terms Fosters Improved Search of OpenNeuro Datasets presented by David Keator</p> <p>The Courtois project on neuronal modeling - first data release presented by Julie A.

BIDS now supports the common principles for describing derivative datasets.</p> <p>Derivatives are the outputs of preprocessing pipelines, capturing data and meta-data sufficient for a researcher to understand and (critically) reuse those outputs in subsequent pipelines.</p> <p>Common principles for derivative datasets:</p> <ul> <li>Derivative datasets describe the contents of the dataset, the methods by which it was generated, and the original dataset(s) that were used to generate it. This metadata is mandatory at the dataset level and optional at the file level.</li> <li>Derivative files must be distinguishable from raw files. A generic description (desc-) entity allows this if no other entity applies.</li> <li>The spatial interpretation of data, if applicable, can be specified with a space entity and SpatialReference metadata.</li> </ul> <p>An initial set of imaging derivatives - binary masks and discrete or probabilistic segmentations - are also specified in this initial offering.</p> <p>We had a long journey to get to here...</p> <p>The need to specify BIDS Derivatives was identified during the early stages of BIDS specification, and a BIDS Extension Proposal (BEP) was started in February 2016, prior to the release of BIDS 1.0 in June 2016.</p> <p>Development of the proposal was largely based on the experience of developing BIDS Apps. As multiple applications produced similar or equivalent derivatives, common naming schemes were added to the proposal to facilitate reuse of the derivatives. For example, the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) and fMRIPrep took similar inputs and had a broad overlap in their outputs, and so made sense to coordinate.</p> <p>An August 2017 meeting at Stanford led to an agreement to divide the increasingly large BEP into a series of BEPs, most focused on particular modalities or use cases.</p> <p>In July 2018, a survey of the neuroimaging community was taken to establish priorities (essential, desirable or inessential) for structural, functional and diffusion MRI derivatives. The results of the survey were posted in advance of an August 2018 workshop of 31 participants, where sub-proposals were pushed toward completion and common principles were established. In December 2018, Release Candidate 1 was published, including all imaging modalities, for implementation and feedback.</p> <p>In July 2019, a \u201cCommon Derivatives\u201d proposal was re-introduced establishing more general principles, to be followed by subsequent modality-specific and non-imaging proposals. Common Derivatives entered final review in May 2020 and were released as part of BIDS 1.4.0 in June 2020.</p> <p>Releasing the common principles for derivative datasets will enable further progress into our modality specific derivative initiatives such as, electopsychological, PET, and diffusion MRI. Our immediate attention will shift to focus on specifying anatomical and functional derivatives (Look out for the pull requests soon!).

Background","text":""},{"location":"collaboration/governance.html#a-project-summary","title":"A. Project Summary","text":"<p>The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a standard specifying the description of neural and associated data in a filesystem hierarchy and of the metadata associated with the imaging data. The current edition of the standard is available in HTML with all the previous editions available since October 2018 (listed in the Changelog). The pre-October 2018 specification editions can be found in this repository as PDFs. The development edition is available in HTML. The specification is based in a GitHub repository and rendered with ReadTheDocs.</p> <p>We strive for community consensus in decision making. This governing model and decision making procedure was developed through the review of several governance models across the informatics and computing field.</p> <p>The project is a community-driven effort. BIDS, originally OBIDS, was initiated during an INCF sponsored data sharing working group meeting (January 2015) at Stanford University. It was subsequently spearheaded and maintained by Chris Gorgolewski. In the transitional period after Chris Gorgolewski's departure in early 2019 and before the community's acceptance of the present governance in late 2019, the project was managed and maintained by Franklin Feingold, Stefan Appelhoff, and the Poldrack Lab at Stanford. BIDS has advanced under the direction and effort of its contributors, the community of researchers that appreciate the value of standardizing neural and associated data to facilitate sharing and analysis. The project is multifaceted and depends on contributors for: specification development and maintenance, BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs), software tools, starter kits, examples, and general discussions. The relevant discussions are located in our Google Group, GitHub organization, and public Google Documents (typically associated with an extension proposal).</p> <p>A key component of the BIDS initiative is the collection of associated software tools and platforms that facilitate the validation and ease the use of BIDS-formatted datasets. BIDS converters (for example, HeuDiConv) enable the streamlined conversion of raw imaging files (for example, DICOMs) into a BIDS dataset, the BIDS validator allows users to confirm that a given dataset complies with the current edition of the standard, the PyBIDS Python and bids-matlab libraries allow querying and manipulating BIDS-compliant datasets, BIDS-Apps for running portable pipelines on validated BIDS datasets, and platforms like OpenNeuro store and serve BIDS datasets. Note that the associated software does not fall under the same governance structure as BIDS, although the contributor and user base may largely overlap.</p>"},{"location":"collaboration/governance.html#b-bids-mission-statement","title":"B.

It is therefore at the discretion of the Steering Group to ensure that modalities are appropriately represented.

Rather than the traditional approach of hiding processes and making them exclusive, open science principles prioritize transparency, diversity, and reproducibility to foster collaboration.</p> <p></p> <p>Imagine you are a carrot farmer trying to make dinner. You could make carrot soup by yourself, but you could also share ingredients with the neighbors to make a much tastier soup with onions, greens, and some salt. Some people may be able to contribute more than others -- but everyone benefits.</p> <p>In neuroscience, data such as magnetic resonance images and physiology readings can be costly in both time and money to acquire. This creates a barrier for many underfunded researchers without access to the required equipment. Responsible data sharing can level the playing field, but incompatible specifications cause portability issues between different labs and scientists. The brain imaging data standard (BIDS) is a framework for organizing data that standardizes datasets across different researchers to enable easier sharing.</p>"},{"location":"collaboration/reports/google_summer/2018-gsoc.html#my-role","title":"My role","text":"<p>The primary goal of this project was to simplify the process of learning about BIDS and engage more users. Well before it was funded by Google, the roots of this initiative were being pioneered by a small group of people around the world that were acting as local BIDS ambassadors in their communities. Many of us were already giving presentations at every workshop and conference possible. However, these were only for a limited audience, and there was a need for central organization of these resources. We hoped to create a central repository accessible to everyone that would contain easy to read documentation and a collection of useful resources.</p> <p>It was my responsibility over the Google Summer of Code to be the lead developer and maintainer of the repository. When responding to requests from both senior developers and new contributors alike, this meant breaking down requested features into action items that could be assigned to either myself or the relevant expert. Periodically, I would then go through the list of issues to make sure progress on them did not \u201cdie out\u201d. As a content creator, my work was primarily focused on the README and wiki. This included writing content and enhancing user experience by designing a clear framework. Although much of this work was documentation, I had to be able to understand the specification to a high technical standard - including the BIDS Apps software that are built from docker images - in order to communicate the information to new users.</p>"},{"location":"collaboration/reports/google_summer/2018-gsoc.html#problem-definitions-and-solutions","title":"Problem definitions and solutions","text":"<p>The title of this project was called Easy BIDS: Starter Kit, and that\u2019s exactly the question that we started with:</p> <p>How do we make this data standard easier to adopt?</p> <p>From there, we broke it down into a series of more discrete problems.</p> <p></p> <p> Problem Which parts of BIDS are people finding most difficult?</p> <p> Solution Through both formal surveys and informal chats, I got feedback from the newcomers to BIDS. The results showed that people were most confused by the technical jargon and metadata file formats.</p> <p></p> <p> Problem The technical documentation about BIDS can be overwhelming.</p> <p> Solution I developed an easy to read reference called the BIDS Starter Kit Wiki. What started as a two page document quickly grew into a compilation of information, tutorials, examples, a glossary, publications, community resources, and many more.</p> <p></p> <p> Problem Engage more users</p> <p> Solution In person, our team continued to spread the word about the project during any relevant events. Online, we created an animated video to summarize the general idea and make the first step that much easier. We developed extensive contribution guidelines to help new contributors add their expertise to the project. We include how to get in touch, write in markdown, submit a pull request and explanations of where to put useful code or links in the wiki. The license on our repository is CC-BY and these guidelines have already been incorporated into other open source neuroimaging projects such as NiBetaSeries. We also used the \u201cgood-first-issue\u201d principle to periodically leave small mistakes in our repository unfixed, such as a typo or an undefined term in the glossary. Then, we would send out a request and guide a new contributor through the process of using the repository.</p> <p>As a result, the number of unique visitors grew from less than 5 to peaks of over 50 per day.</p> <p></p> <p> Problem International project management and communication</p> <p> Solution The members of this project were located in Canada (Elizabeth DuPre), Britain (Kirstie Whitaker), the Netherlands (Dora Hermes), the USA (Chris Gorgolewski and Chris Holdgraf), as well as a collaborator from India (Madhur Tandon). The strategy for this problem was to work publicly and to demonstrate best practice in open source project leadership. This meant rather than waiting until completion to share something, we would continuously post our work in progress and incorporate feedback. Specifically, Github milestones and \u201cclosing soon\u201d tags on issues were helpful to highlight weekly tasks and mark them for review.</p> <p>Despite these strategies, I still felt that the turning point of the project was in June when some of our team finally met in person at the Organization for Human Brain Mapping Hackathon. I was a recipient of a travel award ($500) for this event and it really made a huge difference in my effectiveness as maintainer and content creator for BIDS Starter Kit.

A clear and informative\nREADME makes your data much more usable.\n\nIn general you can include information in the README that is not captured by some other\nfiles in the BIDS dataset (dataset_description.json, events.tsv, ...).\n\nIt can also be useful to also include information that might already be\npresent in another file of the dataset but might be important for users to be aware of\nbefore preprocessing or analyzing the data.\n\nIf the README gets too long you have the possibility to create a `/doc` folder\nand add it to the `.bidsignore` file to make sure it is ignored by the BIDS validator.\n\n## Details related to access to the data\n\n-   [ ] Data user agreement\n\nIf the dataset requires a data user agreement, link to the relevant information.\n\n-   [ ] Contact person\n\nIndicate the name and contact details (email and ORCID) of the person responsible for additional information.\n\n-   [ ] Practical information to access the data\n\nIf there is any special information related to access rights or\nhow to download the data make sure to include it.\nFor example, if the dataset was curated using datalad,\nmake sure to include the relevant section\nfrom the [datalad handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-180-FAQ.html#how-can-i-help-others-get-started-with-a-shared-dataset)\n\n## Overview\n\n-   [ ] Project name (if relevant)\n-   [ ] Year(s) that the project ran\n\nIf no `scans.tsv` is included, this could at least cover when the data acquisition\nstarter and ended. Local time of day is particularly relevant to subject state.\n\n-   [ ] Brief overview of the tasks in the experiment\n\nA paragraph giving an overview of the experiment. This should include the\ngoals or purpose and a discussion about how the experiment tries to achieve\nthese goals.\n\n-   [ ] Description of the contents of the dataset\n\nAn easy thing to add is the output of the bids-validator that describes what type of\ndata and the number of subject one can expect to find in the dataset.\n\n-   [ ] Independent variables\n\nA brief discussion of condition variables (sometimes called contrasts\nor independent variables) that were varied across the experiment.\n\n-   [ ] Dependent variables\n\nA brief discussion of the response variables (sometimes called the\ndependent variables) that were measured and or calculated to assess\nthe effects of varying the condition variables. This might also include\nquestionnaires administered to assess behavioral aspects of the experiment.\n\n-   [ ] Control variables\n\nA brief discussion of the control variables --- that is what aspects\nwere explicitly controlled in this experiment. The control variables might\ninclude subject pool, environmental conditions, set up, or other things\nthat were explicitly controlled.\n\n-   [ ] Quality assessment of the data\n\nProvide a short summary of the quality of the data ideally with descriptive statistics if relevant\nand with a link to more comprehensive description (like with MRIQC) if possible.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Subjects\n\nA brief sentence about the subject pool in this experiment.\n\nRemember that `Control` or `Patient` status should be defined in the `participants.tsv`\nusing a group column.\n\n-   [ ] Information about the recruitment procedure\n-   [ ] Subject inclusion criteria (if relevant)\n-   [ ] Subject exclusion criteria (if relevant)\n\n### Apparatus\n\nA summary of the equipment and environment setup for the\nexperiment. For example, was the experiment performed in a shielded room\nwith the subject seated in a fixed position.\n\n### Initial setup\n\nA summary of what setup was performed when a subject arrived.\n\n### Task organization\n\nHow the tasks were organized for a session.\nThis is particularly important because BIDS datasets usually have task data\nseparated into different files.\n\n-   [ ] Was task order counter-balanced?\n-   [ ] What other activities were interspersed between tasks?\n-   [ ] In what order were the tasks and other activities performed?\n\n### Task details\n\nAs much detail as possible about the task and the events that were recorded.\n\n### Additional data acquired\n\nA brief indication of data other than the\nimaging data that was acquired as part of this experiment. In addition\nto data from other modalities and behavioral data, this might include\nquestionnaires and surveys, swabs, and clinical information. Indicate\nthe availability of this data.\n\nThis is especially relevant if the data are not included\nin a [`phenotype` folder](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03-modality-agnostic-files.html#phenotypic-and-assessment-data).\n\n### Experimental location\n\nThis should include any additional information regarding the\nthe geographical location and facility that cannot be included\nin the relevant json files.\n\n### Missing data\n\nMention something if some participants are missing some aspects of the data.\nThis can take the form of a processing log and/or abnormalities about the dataset.\n\nSome examples:\n\n-   A brain lesion or defect only present in one participant\n\n-   Some experimental conditions missing on a given run for a participant because\n    of some technical issue.\n\n-   Any noticeable feature of the data for certain participants\n\n-   Differences (even slight) in protocol for certain participants.\n\n### Notes\n\nAny additional information or pointers to information that\nmight be helpful to users of the dataset.
