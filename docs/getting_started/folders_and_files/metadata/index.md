Metadata are stored in [.json](./json.md) and [.tsv](./tsv.md) files.

These files are language-agnostic, meaning you can work with them in, for example: Python, Matlab, or R.

This page covers common ways to read/write these files in common languages for neuroscience analysis.

More extensive example templates can be found
[here](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/tree/main/templates),
well as [MATLAB / Octave code](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/tree/main/matlabCode)
and [Python code](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/tree/main/pythonCode)
to help you generate some of those files.
