## BIDS Meeting Notes

### BIDS Seattle meeting recap

-   Successful, groups worked on various projects, a lot of progress was made on BIDS 2.0, new contributors joined

-   New work on BEP for animal modeling (BEP 32?)

-   The budget/expense summary has not been finalized yet, Ariel will work on this and report back to the steering group

-   Will establish a sub-contract at copenhagen to transfer the BIDS award money there

    -   European meeting to be organized in spring 2025?

### BEPs for stimuli and EMG on gitHub

-   What is the official protocol for this?
-   No opposition for the BEP
-   Appears to be an extension of EEG/MEG
-   We are making the decision in support of a BEP number for this work, based on the support from the maintainers

### BIDS 2.0

github project [[bids-standard/projects/10]](https://github.com/orgs/bids-standard/projects/10)

-   Should this get an official BEP?
-   What is the difference between a BEP and a working group? (should this be a working group?)

    -   Currently only a single working group for online progress
    -   This will be paving new directions/definitions of what a working group is and does
    -   Yarik organized the "GitHub Team" BIDS 2.0: [[bids-standard/teams/bids-2-0]](https://github.com/orgs/bids-standard/teams/bids-2-0)

-   Would like feedback on projects on github, big issues have been better formalized
-   Yarik will tackle the hierarchy of file names/inheritances
-   Yarik will work on this at the OHBM Brainhack in June 2024, Seoul
-   INCF and SfN abstracts for BIDS 2.0 - please join is you would like to contribute

    -   Can we get stickers? They are not allowed at SfN

    -   A BIDS 'cheat-sheet' could be distributed as an alternative (1 page print out/flyer)
        including different modalities in BIDS, ongoing BEPs, etc.

### OHBM

-   What does BIDS have at OHBM?

-   Round Table (this is replacing the previous 'townhall')

    -   We need to prepare documentation for this: a slide deck that includes the current state of BEPs
    -   Slide deck should focus on large themes (e.g. getting Asai involvement, BIDS 2.0)
    -   Will there be a hybrid option? Camille will email Beth Slater

-   Cyril will meet Korean/Asian chapter to discuss how to include Asia in BIDS

-   Can we create BIDS stickers for posters that use BIDS

-   Peer has a poster?

-   Round Table/Town hall should have a hybrid option. This should be prioritized for future OHBM meetings,
    if its not a possibility for the Round Table, then we should explore moving back to the OSR Round Table
    so that it can be broadcasted live.

### INCF

-   Good opportunity to promote BEP 32

    -   Yariks postdoc might submit an abstract for this

-   Neurobagel has a participants .tsv standardization schema - should this be harmonized with BIDS 2.0.
    It should help improve the participant.tsv file content

### Participants.tsv

-   NIDM, and Neurobagel try to harmonize metadata in this file.

-   CP proposes that neurobagel should be doing their harmonization work in tandem / within BIDS.

-   Has been discussed at previous brainhacks.

-   We need a schema to standardize how metadata in this file should be structured.

-   This effort needs to be driven by Neurobagel, HED, etc (not driven by BIDS efforts).

-   HED is an example of a case where "external" efforts have contributed to BIDS substantially
    and where the effort goes hand-in-glove with BIDS.

-   YOH formalized above as an issue:
    [[https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-2-devel/issues/74]](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-2-devel/issues/74)

### BIDS working group on BEP process?

-   We need to better characterize when and how to determine what constitutes a BEP

-   Our governance documents could/should be improved to describe this process

-   Needs to address: timelines, voting processes,

    -   Anthony supports having a BEP timeline proposed and presented to be voted on at the next BIDS elections.

    -   Some form of rules to know, regular check-ins

    -   Chris has notes from the Seattle meeting discussion on this topic: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/10oa3rCNMDOdtprc7\_009uctfkOQqDJJVoK8dipgE6S4/edit\#heading=h.hxv1sz2uaf5f]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10oa3rCNMDOdtprc7_009uctfkOQqDJJVoK8dipgE6S4/edit#heading=h.hxv1sz2uaf5f)
