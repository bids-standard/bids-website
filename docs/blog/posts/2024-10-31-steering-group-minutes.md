## Maintainers Updates

-   should there be another in-person sprint for the maintainers group?
    -   support for making the meeting smaller than the previous meeting

-   is there funding for this?

-   suggestion:  select a few BEPs to work on to complete during the meeting

-   suggestion: recap this discussion with the full steering group and also provide a proposal for the meeting.

-   AG suggestion:  host meeting in Pitsburg, potentially more affordable location. AG will follow up with the other maintainers.

-   there were only 10 responses to the survey about the new BIDS website, they would like more.
    -   DH: not as many people use X/twitter, could they use LinkedIn?
    -   AG: will create a text blurb for people to share on LinkedIn

## BIDS election

-   the election has a quorum, so the election will be accepted.
-   the new member could potentially join the next meeting on Nov 21st and/or December (12th?) before Ariel formally vacates his position.

## BIDS 2.0

-   AR: potential for funding for a BIDS 2.0 effort?  will an NSF POSE application for the funding be submitted?

-   YH: is interested.  They are looking for who could potentially lead the efforts in the grant proposal.

-   AR: Proposal is due Jan 14th, AR and YH are over committed.

-   YH: Funding would be good, but is the work put into the grant proposal worth the possibility of funding?
    This is why we need to identify the right individuals that can complete the work.

-   AR: the following proposal is September 2025.
    There is a phase 1 (7 page proposal, $300k directs total for 2 years) and phase 2 funding mechanism.

-   YH: stage 1: we should create working groups to identify areas where BIDS can grow

-   AR: we need to fund management

-   YH: we also need more support for maintainers and their work load.

-   YH: we need a 'marketing analysis', we should aim for the Phase 1 proposal, YH will lead.
    'I'm on, but I need support with the proposal'

-   AR: can help

-   DH: we do a lot of active data collection and use BIDS for datasharing, they are happy for testing new BIDS things.
