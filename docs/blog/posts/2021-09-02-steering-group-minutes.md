    <p>
     KW will be rotated out - will be invited back to give advice on specific topics (for example community development)
    </p>
    <p>
     From the governing structure:
    </p>
    <p>
     Initially, Steering Group members will be elected for staggered terms of 2/3/4 years, to allow continuity and overlap across years. This will ensure institutional knowledge is preserved within the BIDS Steering Group. In the initial BIDS Steering Group, there will be at least one non-MRI modality represented. -&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
     One person drops after 1 year, 2 more after 2 and 2 more after 4.
