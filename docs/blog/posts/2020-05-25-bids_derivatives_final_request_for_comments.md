# BIDS Derivatives final request for comments

The BIDS community is preparing to merge the Common Derivatives extension. ~~The updated draft is available for review at X, and comments and suggestions may be submitted on GitHub at [https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/265](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/265)~~.

UPDATE 2021-06-14: The draft is no longer accessible. You can instead look at the [stable version](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/05-derivatives/01-introduction.html)

<!--more-->

The scope of this extension is establishing a set of common principles for organizing derivative datasets, dataset-level metadata, and naming conventions for minimally preprocessed files. Additionally, some common imaging derivatives (e.g., brain masks) have been specified. More detailed modality-specific derivatives are scheduled for inclusion in the next few months.

The final review process entails a minimum of one week for public comment, with a possibility of extension for unresolved discussion. Once public comments are concluded, there will be a one week freeze, during which only critical issues will be considered. (For more details on the release protocol, see [https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/Release_Protocol.md](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/Release_Protocol.md) .)

We look forward to hearing your feedback!
Franklin
