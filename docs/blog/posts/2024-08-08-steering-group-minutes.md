-   Are there additional projects/initiaves that could be part of DANDI?

## CogSci

New meeting in Boston, not sure that there will be BIDS representation there.

## Other maintainer Questions

-   Would be good to start OHBM prep further in advance (~6mo?), including assigning tasks. (This year was a bit rushed.)
    -   need a more clear outline of duties for Steering Group and Maintainers
    -   Should BIDS Roundtable meeting go back to the OSR (to ensure hybrid engagement) or stick with OHBM to be included in the program
    -   Considering the upcoming Brisbane location, there may be a higher need for hybrid/virtual engagement
    -   Does BIDS townhall need to happen at OHBM? Or could it be a stand alone meeting.

-   $20 for [Opavote](https://opavote.com/) for election.
    -   steering group supports, Ariel (Yarik as backup) will support financially.

-   Somewhat inchoate coordination woes:

    -   "we are seeing more requests, is there a coordinator role already that can respond?
        If not, how should the general inquiries be routed?"

    -   Could the contributing page help identify where to direct queries (e.g. a contact for interviews, press...)?
        We currently have a contact page [on the new website](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/contact/index.html)
        (which might not be sufficient)

## BIDS Virtual Meeting?

-   Should BIDS move their annual meeting "roundtable" outside of OHBM?
-   Chris will bring the dicsussion to the Maintainers.
