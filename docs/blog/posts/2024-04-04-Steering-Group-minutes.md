## BIDS Meeting Notes

### BIDS.org

-   \$70 is the broker fee to negotiate for the BIDS.org domain
-   Steering group thinks that 4 letter URLS are likely very costly to acquire and we will not be able to afford
-   A quick search on the IP shows that bids.org is owned by "web addresses for businesses inc", so...

### MATTERmost

-   The BIDS slack group is costly , the maintainers are likely moving mattermost
-   The has been a group created for the steering groups, should they utilize this channel?
-   Stanford & MIT have enterprise accounts for Slack, which could allow for BIDS to have a slack channel under their license.

    -   Yarik/Satra might be able to help with this at MIT
    -   Russ/Ross at Stanford, (but would prefer to not have BIDS slack within Stanford?)

### BEPs - stalling (related to the BIDS connectivity BEPS)

-   Franco unable to attend meetings
-   Hoping to find a solution for how to keep BEPs moving forward
-   Franco, Yarik, and Ariel will be at the upcoming BIDS maintainers meeting in Seattle, they may try to begin a discussion and proposed solutions

    -   Meeting facilities have good zoom capabilities, Dora may join this conversation virtually, others might is possible,

-   Proposed solutions should be brought back to the steering group for further discussion

### BIDS maintenance Infrastructure Award Spending

-   Ariel has a google doc with the BIDS maintainers
    (2024 Seattle BIDS maintainers meeting goals)
    that lists requests from BIDS maintainers and community on financial needs for BIDS

BEP BIDS Technical committee (proposal to aid with stalled BEPS)

[[https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-extensions/pull/29]](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-extensions/pull/29)

-   Should we invite Oscar for discussion with the BIDS steering group?

-   The complaints are not clear and there have not been alternative solutions proposed to address the issue

-   Dora proposed meeting with Oscar (~~possibly with Ariel?~~
    to better understand the concerns and bring it to the steering committee,
    she would like another person to join the conversation if more clarity or context is needed
