## Agenda

        - June 10-13
2. Mathew Abrams - INCF Fiscal Sponsorship `30min`
    make a summary of INCF as official fiscal sponsor + subcontractor on grants -- to be discussed among maintainers and checked by Mathew then the community should vote on that proposal
3. Maintainers Updates
    - Copenhagen BIDS Maintainers meeting: do we need a theme to justify this or can we have it as maintainers meeting only?
    - New BEP PRs:
      - https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/2022 - BEP044 Stimuli
    - Maintainers to develop the BEP timeline with promotion/demotion and some criteria

## Mathew Abrams - INCF Fiscal Sponsorship

- benefits: improved access to funding,
- community building services:  web development, conference servcies, financial management, coordinate working groups, management of training groups
- dedicated Q&A forum for BIDS via Neurostars
- resources for capacity building:  can leverage their training space for education on BIDS
- marketing packages via INCF community
- Fees: 10% of annual budget, 15% of total budget funds recieved through grants
- Discussed the links between the BIDS community and INCF
- NIH applications (@Yaroslaw if you can fill in that would be great!)
- No restrictions on how little the received money can be (e.g. awards).
- NIH grant, sub-award for INCF?
- Help (paid) organize events?
    - possibility to pay for flights or to reimburse individuals through expense claims, INCF takes the admin burden of the reimbursement.
    - provide extra services to organize meetings etc
- "Sign off" on agreements on behalf of BIDS?  should be possible, needs to be checked specifically (Yarik would share docs on SHARAZA-IHE)
- INCF is already doing fiscal sponsorship with multiple projects including: Scicrunch w/ grant from CZI, community coordination for the Mathworks neuroscience community, Repronim, bridge.

- Can pay money for developeers/contributors if they have their own company or if a company can play this role (typically takes around 25% in total). Within Europe can be done for the one used by INCF for consultants (down to 18%).
- Researched into other similar companies and their models ... e.g. some NYC company named after Belgian king ;)
