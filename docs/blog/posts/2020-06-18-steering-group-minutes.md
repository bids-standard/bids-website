## Executive Summary

We discussed and decided on utilizing the [BrainHack Mattermost platform][brainhack_mattermost] for our instant messaging solution. This fits nicely into where our community has been informally organized.

We went over our BIDS presentations occurring in the [Open Science Room](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/schedule/) at [OHBM](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3885). We are sharing on the website [all the BIDS presentations and posters](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/blog/2020/06/19/BIDS%20at%20OHBM%202020.html) happening at OHBM. There are many BIDS-aware tools being developed, but an emphasis should be put on generating the associated documentation.
