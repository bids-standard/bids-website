## Executive Summary

The Steering Group met to discuss the latest updates on the [PET extension](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/633).
The extension is getting closer to completion.
We spent the majority of the meeting with the [BEP031: Microscopy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nlu6QVQrbOQtdtcRarsONbX5SrOubXWBvkV37LRRqrc/edit) leads.
They introduced the motivation and scale of the effort.
There appears to be adjacent ongoing initiatives that could be good to be aligned with.
It could be beneficial to introduce a species metadata entity to tease apart the incorporation of the methodology from the species.
The BEP031 leads will meet with the [Maintainers Group](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/DECISION-MAKING.md#maintainers-group) to further discuss their lingering questions.

## Minutes

-   Developing the PET extension of the BIDS-validator

The Steering Group spent the rest of the meeting with the [BEP031: Microscopy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nlu6QVQrbOQtdtcRarsONbX5SrOubXWBvkV37LRRqrc/edit) leads

-   The motivation for this BEP was the MRI community uses microscopy to validate qMRI recordings
-   Range of microscopy data: primarily 2D imaging flavors, some interest to extend into 3D imaging
-   Format: single .png, accommodate .oct for 3D imaging
-   Addressing in vivo and ex vivo
-   There are other types of standards and data structures
-   [Recent preprint on bioarxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.10.430563v2) from the SPARC group
-   Detail level questions can be opened as issues in the [bids-specification repository][specification_gh] to get Maintainers thoughts
-   The [Neuroscience Data Structure](https://github.com/INCF/neuroscience-data-structure/issues) group is another team thinking about this
-   Considering species, formats, and experiments
-   Microscopy could be split into microscopy and mouse/animal
-   Mouse/animal would be primarily metadata additions similar to genetics and HED
-   Adding sample entity, could be a separate pull request
-   For breaking down large files into smaller ones: `split` is for temporal and `chunk` could be used for spatial
-   Suggest using the entity that a particular community is familiar and comfortable with
-   Perhaps adding species into BIDS
-   May be through `participants.tsv`
