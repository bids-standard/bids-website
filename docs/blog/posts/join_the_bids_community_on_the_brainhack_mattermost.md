BIDS is joining the [BrainHack Mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/)!

<!-- more -->

We are proud to announce our home for hosting BIDS organization instant messaging: the [BrainHack Mattermost platform](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/)! In the past few years, several BIDS channels have independently been created on Mattermost by the community.
The Steering Group and Maintainers Group have chosen to recognize the BrainHack Mattermost as a member of our organizations's official communication suite.
This platform will live alongside our other official communication channels:

- NeuroStars (forum for support questions)
- mailing list (announcements)
- Twitter (community news)
- and GitHub repositories (bug reports + feature requests).

We have listed below our current set of BIDS channels. We will be establishing several BIDS channels related to: BEP development, community discussions, and more! Check it out and create your own channel! Please be sure the channel name contains `bids` in the title to increase findability.

[Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) is an open-source alternative to Slack. The user interface and experience is very similar to that on Slack. One may join a channel, make a channel, or private message.

To find our `BIDS` channels, please navigate to Mattermost and click `More...` at the bottom of the `PUBLIC CHANNELS` section. A prompt will pop up enabling you to search for our `BIDS` related channels. If you have any issues, please message Franklin on Mattermost: `@franklin_`.

The [BrainHack project](https://www.brainhack.org/) seeks to bridge the neuroscience and data science communities through hackathons and unconferences.
To do this, they convene unique conferences comprised of researchers from around the world with diverse backgrounds and interests to develop our next generation of open source software for neuroscience.
These workshops consist of educational activities, along with plenty of development time.

We look forward to seeing you on Mattermost!
