## Executive Summary

The Steering Group began the meeting by discussing a new potential BEP and meeting with BEP lead to learn more.
We covered how BIDS suggested authorship can look like and how to convey this information to BEP leads.
The monthly Maintainers report could be transformed to convey more information to the BIDS community
through the [bids-discussion list](https://groups.google.com/g/bids-discussion).
The website is under development with passes currently ongoing to enhance.
In the future, we could reach out to imaging acquisition companies to further adopt BIDS in their systems.

-   Contribution ability for the platform affects decision?

    -   Should be on GitHub because we are a community project
