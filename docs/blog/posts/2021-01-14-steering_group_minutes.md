## Executive Summary

This meeting was primarily spent discussing our approach for crediting the Steering and Maintainers Group in BEP manuscripts. We will be using the [credit taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/) for helping to recognize contributors. These guidelines can be added to the [BEP lead guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWmEEY-1-WuwBPNy5tDAxVJYQ9Een4hZJM06tQZg8X4/edit). We want to give our community members the opportunity to be credited for their contributions to a BEP.
