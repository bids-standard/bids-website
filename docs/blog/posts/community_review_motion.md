The BIDS community is preparing to merge the BIDS Extension Proposal 29 (BEP029) for Motion data.

<!-- more -->

The updated draft is available for review at:

[https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modality-specific-files/motion.html](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modality-specific-files/motion.html)

Note that the content of that HTML page may change as suggestions are accepted during the review process.

Comments and suggestions may be submitted on GitHub at:

[https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/981](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/981)

The community review will close on Wednesday (March 8th) at 23:59 UTC.

If no larger issues occur, all open comments and suggestions will be resolved in the following days and merged into the BEP.
Afterwards, the BEP will be merged into the BIDS specification, followed by a 5-business-day long feature freeze and the release of BIDS 1.9.0
(then containing Motion as a modality, among several more minor changes as documented in the BIDS changelog).
