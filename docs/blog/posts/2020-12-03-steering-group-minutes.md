## Executive Summary

This was a joint meeting between the Steering and Maintainers Group. We began this meeting by discussing the status of the [ASL BEP](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/669). This BEP has completed the community review and the Maintainers are preparing to incorporate the extension into the standard. We found large portions of [BEP001](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pulls?q=is%3Apr+bep001) will also go into the next release. We spent the majority of our meeting discussing how we can provide guidance to BEP leads regarding [crediting the Steering and Maintainers group](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/627). We evaluated several different potential approaches.

## Minutes

-   [ASL BEP](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/669) and next release:
-   Whether to merge ASL BEP before holidays will be left up to Maintainers.
-   Releasing ASL and most of BEP001
-   Crediting:
-   Maintainership counts as "substantial contributions to the conception of the work" (one of [ICMJE](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) criteria).
-   Look at [https://credit.niso.org/](https://credit.niso.org/) for authorship roles
  -Roles that are applicable: data curation and software
  -Resources potentially too
-   Include recommended (but not required) text for including Steering/Maintainers as coauthors and description of roles. Requiring credit goes against open values of standard.
  -Split Steering group and Maintainer group descriptions/recommendations given different levels of engagement.
  -Generally will be Steering Group + Maintainers or just Maintainers.
-   Add columns to Maintainers table with start date and end date, and self-selection on whether to include on papers if authors think the ex-Maintainer contributed.
-   Authorship credit could be equal among our groups. BEP leads can make the decision.
-   Preference may be a BIDS Maintainers consortia author -[Credit taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/) could address and report specific contributions
-   To help avoid confusion regarding how to add a corporate author, we may provide a few examples of how it can be done
