## HackMD transition

-   We are going to try this out and see how it goes
-   Will this go into a GitHub repo in a manner that we can browse in the future?
-   Can we retain links to minute docs in the Google Drive, like it has been for Gdocs?
-   Lets use this for the next 3 meetings and determine if we stick with it.

## OHBM town hall timeline

-   June 23-27, 2024 Seoul

-   Lets work backwards from estimated June 27 Townhall meeting

-   BIDS maintainers report: historically a powerpoint presenting BEP updates

-   get updates from BEP leads

-   highlight the Open Science Prize and recent BIDS publications

-   Presentation should take no longer than 30 minutes to allow for more discussion afterwards

-   Should we reorganize the structure of the presentation into BEP categories?

    -   strive to highlight what has changed over the past year

    -   include version updates

    -   list new BEPs (since the last townhall)
        -   BEP 42: EMG
        -   BEP 43: term mapping

    -   include BIDS 2.0 (Yarik added TODO slide)

    -   highlight new contributors

    -   may be mention the theme of "year of adoption", suggest audience can support adoption

    -   audience involvement, however OHBM will likely request ppt slides in advance

    -   include survey results from community challenges/barriers to BIDS adoption

-   We should reduce the overall number of slides,

-   how do discuss improving the diversity of BIDS contributors and community

    -   We need this at all levels: adoptions, contributors, BEP leads, and governance

    -   can be more inclusive by having different skillsets within the BIDS community (not just coders)

    -   we could use the location of the meeting as a way to improve the diversity

    -   we should address multiple areas of diversity: gender, location, background of the people (e.g. computer science, medical
        doctors, neuroscience)  and this at different levels of BIDS (users, contributors, BEP leads, steering & maintainers) --
        Camille: I am happy to contribute here

-   should we order BIDS stickers and stickers for posters using BIDS

-   will BIDS townhall be hybrid?

-   Does BIDS have standard flyers for OHBM?  Yarik volunteered to share his Dandi booth to host BIDS

## BIDS 2.0

-   INCF abstract

-   Should this be a BEP or Working Group?

-   See formal process on BIDS website for establishing such a working group.
    -   this is separate from the BEP working group

-   this is different than a typical BEP and should get wider community input

-   governance doc says that a working group should advance the BIDS community, not the standard

-   Stefan will ask the maintainers for their opinions if it should be BEP or Working Group
