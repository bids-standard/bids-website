BIDS Meeting Notes:

**April Maintainers Meeting in Seattle**: April 11-12, Arial can
currently fund travel within the US (NSF funding), the OS Prize can fund
non-US travel. They have a meeting space at the E-science institute and
can provide space.

Ariel needs: meeting attendees list, meeting agenda,

Stefan to pass on to the maintainers to see if someone is up to making
the program/defining attendees list

**BIDS 2.0**

Github project is established with many ideas but there aren\'t many
\'takers' on completing the suggested items.

-   Creating a more flexible hierarchy for BIDS
    ([[https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-2-devel/issues/54]{.underline}](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-2-devel/issues/54)
    )

-   What are the most important items that should be attended to?

-   Long term goal should be to make BIDS adoption easier, will a 2.0
    version create more confusion between versions or how can we make
    BIDS 2.0 improve adoption from community

    -   While presenting 2.0 we would like to accent that to be
        developed in 2.0 features would help ?

-   Revisiting how BIDS is defined beyond MRI may be a path to improving
    adoption within the neuroscience community. I.e. BIDS started with
    MRI and some of the BIDS spec might be more complicated than could
    have been if we had focused on all modalities from the start.

    -   iEEG, MEG,\... -

    -   Perhaps a tool for automatic BIDS conversions would help, but
        there are at least 20 different file formats for
        electrophysiology data

-   

**Open Science Prize!**

-   What should we do with the physical prize? We could 3D print
    replicate the model to share among the maintainers/steering
    committee.

-   What to do with the prize money?

    -   How do we receive the money? - \$5k CAD per person or \$55k CAD
        to be spent as needed for BIDS

-   \$55k CAD will be split with U Washington and Cyril (sub-contract
    with xx Institution) so funds will be in both US and Europe

**BIDS Steering Committee Theme for the year: Improve adoption**

-   Web presence (already in process - meeting established for Jan 12th)

-   Training and dissemination

    -   How do we poll non-BIDS users to understand barriers to BIDS
        adoption?

        -   Big consortia (OHBM, SfN, INCF, \...)

        -   People who have adopted BIDS but not fully

        -   Openneuro bidsignore files

        -   Should we target specific regions such as Asia which has
            historically provided few contributions to BIDS

-   First steps: create and agree on a survey for non-BIDS users

    -   Create a pull request for this survey:

        -   Are they aware of BIDS?

        -   Was it hard to convert data?

        -   Do you use data that do not yet fit within BIDS?

        -   Had questions, but could not find answers

        -   

    -   [[Yaroslav Halchenko]{.underline}](mailto:yarikoptic@gmail.com)
        will create a pull request on github:
        [[https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/pull/376]{.underline}](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/pull/376)
