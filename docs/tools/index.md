# BIDS Tools

There is a rich ecosystem of tools to help you work with BIDS datasets.

- Converters: There are many [converters](./converters/index.md)
to help you go from your sourcedata to have a BIDS dataset.
- BIDS Validator: The [BIDS validator](./validator.md) is there to ensure that your BIDS dataset is valid and will work with BIDS Apps without any obvious issues.
- BIDS Apps: You can use [BIDS apps](./bids-apps.md)
(automated pipelines that can be used as Docker or Apptainer images)
to process your BIDS datasets.
- Misc: There are many other [tools](./others.md) to help you work with, edit, or curate BIDS datasets.
