## Measuring BIDS Impact

### Datasets

Over the years, the number of shared datasets available to the public has 
greatly increased. At its heart, adoption of the BIDS standard across datasets 
aids in the sharing of data and collaboration of research through the standardization 
of descriptive files names and the organization of data. BIDS organized datasets are 
available through public repositories such as [Openneuro.org](https://openneuro.org/) 
and the number of publicly available BIDS datasets continues to grow every year.

### Citation Count

As the adoption of the BIDS standard across neuroimaging datasets has grown, so have 
citations for work that uses BIDS data and BIDS apps. To aid in searching for publications 
relevant to the BIDS standard, we have included some examples of BIDS references that are 
centralized in a [zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5111637/bids)

### GitHub stars
GitHub stars quantify the number of users that have marked a repository as a favorite and have 
chosen to follow the changes made to that repository. Below is a table of GitHub repos that are 
associated with the BIDS standard and their star count. By tracking repo interest via GitHub stars, 
we can quantify which BIDS-associated tools are of the highest interest to the research community.
