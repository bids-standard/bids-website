# BIDS Impact

The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is an open global community driving the 
standardization of neuroscience data across a broad and growing range of modalities 
and health research disciplines. First released in June 2016, it is supported by a 
worldwide research network and endorsed by organizations like the International 
Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility ([INCF](https://www.incf.org/)).

BIDS encompasses:

- Over 40 domain-specific and modality-specific technical specifications across
scientific and technical domains.
- 100+ sample data models for BIDS specifications in 
[bids-examples](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples). Read more about
the [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- 2000 open datasets across repositories including 
[OpenNeuro](https://www.openneuro.org). Read more about [BIDS Datasets](/docs/datasets/index.md).
- Open software conversion and analytics tools, and global infrastructure for
collaborating on emerging standards in neuroscience 
[Poldrack, et al, 2024](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00103/119672/The-past-present-and-future-of-the-brain-imaging).
- ~30,000 annual website visits from a very large community of neuroscience researchers 
actively consulting the BIDS specifications (April 2023-24).
- Over 300 BIDS contributors currently supporting and maintaining BIDS community 
resources and tools.
- Open working processes through online collaborative tools including GitHub, 
GitHub Pages, ReadTheDocs, Google Docs, and OSF.
  
The BIDS core steering and maintainers groups work with the community to optimize open 
adherence to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, 
[Wilkinson, et al, 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)) and to actively 
lower barriers to adoption.

## Measuring BIDS Impact

### Datasets

Over the years, the number of shared datasets available to the public has 
greatly increased. At its heart, adoption of the BIDS standard across datasets 
aids in the sharing of data and collaboration of research through the standardization 
of descriptive files names and the organization of data. BIDS organized datasets are 
available through public repositories such as [Openneuro.org](https://openneuro.org/) 
and the number of publicly available BIDS datasets continues to grow every year.

### Citation Count

As the adoption of the BIDS standard across neuroimaging datasets has grown, so have 
citations for work that uses BIDS data and BIDS apps. To aid in searching for publications 
relevant to the BIDS standard, we have included some examples of BIDS references that are 
centralized in a [zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5111637/bids)

### GitHub stars
GitHub stars quantify the number of users that have marked a repository as a favorite and have 
chosen to follow the changes made to that repository. Below is a table of GitHub repos that are 
associated with the BIDS standard and their star count. By tracking repo interest via GitHub stars, 
we can quantify which BIDS-associated tools are of the highest interest to the research community.

## BIDS History

Since its origin, the BIDS standard has revolutionized the way in which neuroimaging
research is done. The origin of the BIDS standard is commonly traced back to 2014, 
when a social media post ignited a deeper discussion about a new way of sharing 
data, that would ultimately lead to a set of standards that would improve scientific 
collaboration efforts. 

Following this initial discussion (and on the shoulders of many many volunteer hours 
by maintainers and the community at large) the BIDS standard saw significant adoption 
in the neuroimaging research landscape and continues to expand every day. A more complete 
history and discussion about the future of the BIDS landscape can be found in this 
[recent publication](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10516110/).

The BIDS standard continues to be adopted by a larger share of the community each year. 
We have seen a large and growing number of visitors to the BIDS website. A large number of
BIDS users also continue to explore the BIDS Specification and contribute to the community every month. 

We also document centers, institutes, and databases around the world that have implemented BIDS as
their organizational structure. While the list continues to grow, an initial list of centers and the associated
BIDS initiatives or database can be found 
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aySjPpEGGQwFcOavkQdcvk2t2UMXt_zoTzWLWUmq20M/edit#gid=0).

### Website and Specification traffic dashboards

In order to measure the volume of traffic to our website and the
[ReadTheDocs rendering of the specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
we utilize Google Analytics.

For visualizing our metrics, we have put together 2 dashboards:

1.  [the website](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/eab164ba-9f98-46e8-bee8-1f4f5328dc6e/page/V5leB)
1.  [the specification](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/57bf46f1-034c-4d8b-9fe2-3a2243e469c5/page/w1leB)

The default time period is set to the past 6 months. This can be changed by
adjusting the time period in the upper left corner. Please feel free to use any
of these figures in your grant! If there are additional statistics not currently
conveyed, please reach out to or the BIDS maintainers via a GitHub issue, or by email
 ([bids.maintenance@gmail.com](mailto:bids.maintenance@gmail.com)).

### BIDS usage

We ran
[a survey](https://reproducibility.stanford.edu/bids-usage-survey-results/) in
June 2019 to evaluate the uptake of BIDS in the community. We received feedback
from 116 global researchers.

We have a
[google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aySjPpEGGQwFcOavkQdcvk2t2UMXt_zoTzWLWUmq20M/edit#gid=0)
that is crowdsourcing imaging centers, institutes, databases around the world
that have implemented BIDS as their organizational structure.

### Neurostars

We also track the interest and usage of the BIDS standard via discussions on Neurostars 
to help us estimate trends in usage. Below is a snapshot as of ??? (date).

### Mailing list volume

As of July 1, 2020, we have 183 people signed up for our
[BIDS email list](https://forms.gle/JFo2aEkYbKY4EbmE6) and 412 members on our
[google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bids-discussion).


## How the BIDS team can help you

If you are in the process of putting together a grant, **please email/message
the pillar lead** that is most closely associated with your proposed grant or the 
BIDS maintainers email ([bids.maintenance@gmail.com](mailto:bids.maintenance@gmail.com)) 
so we may help support this. Our organization is structured into 3 pillars: standard,
tools, and collaboration.

Our range of support covers activities such as: meeting with the Steering and
Maintainers Groups to assisting with connecting you with other BIDS grant
writers or related initiatives to receiving a letter of support from the
Steering Group.

Regarding **requesting a letter of support** - please submit a drafted letter of
support to the collaboration lead or the BIDS maintainers email 
([bids.maintenance@gmail.com](mailto:bids.maintenance@gmail.com)) so we may review internally.

Please include how you plan on giving back to the BIDS community. The primary
mechanism is to support a member of your team to become a BIDS Maintainer.
Letters of support are approved by the Steering Group. This process may take 2-4
weeks to complete.

We kindly ask you to please **share your grant online** - successful or not.
This will signal to the rest of the community what avenues we have pursued and
what our fellow colleagues are planning on doing next. These can be grants that
directly extend our support into a new domain, grants that help BIDS (for example
OpenNeuro), or unsuccessful grant applications.

For example, please find our [NIH-R24 Brain Initiative BIDS-Derivatives grant](https://osf.io/c3dgx/).

A listing of the previous grants can be found [here](../collaboration/acknowledgments.md)

## Citing BIDS in your project 
You can find information on citing BIDS standards for specific modalities and 
citing BIDS in general 
[in the specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#citing-bids)

<!--
## Future steps: TODO

- add country of origin to contributor appendix
- nb of datasets (openneuro or else):
  - where are they from
  - gender of dataset authors
- Enhance news and events when collaboration pillar is established
- Sharing previous BIDS grants: when the organizational design is completed, we
  can establish a common area to place this information.
