You can also contribute to ongoing BIDS Extension Proposals.
Below is a table of currently-active BEPs.
The "Extension label" column provides a direct link to the documentation.

Please find our
[latest BEP update](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uvxJaGgrk58HBWRqLzJTwHjpJKFLGM7YTiNvGwvjMOA/edit?usp=sharing){:target:"_blank"}
presented in the Open Science Room at
[OHBM](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4041){:target:"_blank"}.

Note that all of the extension ideas that are not backwards compatible and thus will have to wait for BIDS 2.0 are listed on the
[Issues page of the bids-2-devel GitHub repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-2-devel/issues).

### Completed BEPs

When an extension reaches maturity it is merged into the main body of the specification.
Below is a table of BEPs that have been merged.

The references of the final publication for those BEPS
can be found in the BIDS [specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-introduction.html#datatype-specific-publications).

Some proposals that set out to extend the BIDS specification have instead lead to other outcomes such as:

- becoming tools for handling BIDS
- having been merged into other BEPs
- having been dropped from consideration
