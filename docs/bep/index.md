# Get involved in making BIDS better

<u>Neurostars Website</u>

- The easiest way to contribute to BIDS is to ask questions you have about the specification on
[Neurostars](https://neurostars.org).
- If your question has a
[bids tag](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids)
it will be much easier for others to find the answer.
- You can also get involved by _answering_ questions on
[Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids)!

<u>Github Issues</u>

- You can contribute to the BIDS specification by opening
[Issues](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues)
and proposing changes via
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pulls)
on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification).
- To make improvements to the website that you are reading right now, you can also open an
[Issue](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website/issues)
and propose changes via Pull Requests at the
[BIDS website GitHub repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website).

<u> Become a part of the BIDS Community </u>

There are so many ways to help us build this community.

- You could help someone else learn the benefits of BIDS by giving a talk in your local organization
-  Or you could work on [building a BIDS App](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/)!

<b>The only requirement is that everyone who contributes adheres to our
[BIDS Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).</b>

Thank you for your contributions!

## Extending the BIDS specification

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and will evolve over time.
These are accomplished with BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs), which are community-driven processes.

Do you want to learn more about extending BIDS to a new modality or set of data types?
Read the [Guide](https://bids-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/)
and follow the [Submission Process](https://bids-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submission/).
