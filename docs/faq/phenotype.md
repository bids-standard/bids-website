## How can I store subject phenotypic data?

In the phenotype folder, according to the details provided for
[phenotypes](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03-modality-agnostic-files.html#phenotypic-and-assessment-data):

```text
bids-root
    phenotype
```

Please the see work on the [BIDS extension proposal for phenotypes](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/bep036)
for more guidelines.

## Is there a standard for epilepsy phenotypes?

Yes, open this
[epilepsyClassification2017](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/blob/main/interactiveTreeVisualization/epilepsyClassification2017/tree.html)
and follow the examples in the
[phenotype templates](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/tree/main/templates/phenotype).
