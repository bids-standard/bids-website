## Can we introduce new entities / metadata in a BEP?

The rule of thumb is:
try to reuse as much as possible existing entities or medata.
If you feel that those are too restrictive,
it may be possible to first extend the definitions of those
to better cover your use case.
If that is still not possible then you can introduce new entity or metadata.

See
[bids-specification issue #1177](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/1177)
for an example of the reasoning that led to the application of an entity
previously used for functional data to anatomical MRI.
