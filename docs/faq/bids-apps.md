## Can I add more arguments to the API of my App?

Every BIDS App must use the mandatory arguments mentioned above, but you are
free to add more that are specific to the task your App will perform.

We recommend you follow the guidelines mentioned in the
[BIDS extension proposal 027](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/bep027)
for more information on specifying the API of your App.

## How can I check a version of a container I have available locally?

Inside each BIDS App there is a /version file with the version number.

This file is automatically populated with tag used to trigger the build on the CI server.

## How can I download a particular version of a BIDS App?

All versions of BIDS Apps are archived on Docker Hub. To access a particular
version you should refer to a specific Docker Hub tag. For example:

```bash
docker pull bids/example:v0.0.5
```

## How do I upload my BIDS App to the BIDS App Github org?

You can release BIDS Apps using your own or your lab's account.
However, if you want to be added to the BIDS docker hub,
please message the [BIDS maintainers](mailto:bids.maintenance+apps@gmail.com)
to have a repo created for you.

If you base your code on <https://github.com/bids-apps/example> deployment on
docker hub will happen automatically via Circle-ci.

If you want your App to show on the BIDS App website
[here](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/apps/), you will in any case have to
update the `_config.yml` in the
[BIDS App website repository](https://github.com/bids-apps/bids-apps.github.io.git).

## How should I version my BIDS App?

Since most BIDS Apps are just thin wrappers around existing pipelines it would
be most sensible to use the same version as the software they are wrapping.

For example in case of HCP Pipelines this would be `v3.17.0`.

## How to tag a new release?

```bash
git tag v0.0.1
git push
```

## I want to release a new version of a BIDS App, but the pipeline version is the same?

This can happen when only the runscript or the Dockerfile changed?
According to semantic versioning we should use the `+` signed followed by the build number.
Unfortunately Docker Hub does not support semantic versioning.
The best option is to use the `-` sign followed by the build number.
For example `v3.17.0-3`.

## Is it mandatory to first check the dataset validity using the BIDS-validator?

It is an extremely helpful feature to have validation of the dataset as part of your tool.
However, it's not considered mandatory.
For instance: many Apps will
simply fail with an error message if the dataset is not BIDS compliant.

## Is there a BIDS App template?

Have a look at the
[example BIDS App repository](https://github.com/bids-apps/example). A
minimalist example of a BIDS App consisting of a Dockerfile and a simple entry
point script (written in this case in Python) accepting the standard BIDS Apps
command line arguments.

## What do the analysis levels (`participant` and `group`) mean?

Generally, `participant` means individual level analysis (for instance: single
subject) The group level analysis can be thought of as the second step, where
the input becomes the output of the `participant` level analysis.

For example, generating statistic maps of each subject's brain could be
considered `participant`, while generating the average of these maps across the
dataset could be considered `group`.

## What do we do if our application does not have any use for the group level analysis?

If your pipeline has no need for group level analysis, it is fine if it is only
valid for the analysis_level argument (see
[fmriprep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html))

## What should the API of my BIDS App look like?

The obligatory arguments of the API of any BIDS App are:

-   `bids_dir`
-   `output_dir`
-   `analysis_level`

with an API call that would look like this:

```bash
app_name bids_dir output_dir analysis_level
```

## When is a new image deposited to Docker Hub?

Even though Docker image is being build on the CI server each time
you push a commit to the repository it is not automatically being pushed to Docker Hub.
Only if you tag a commit, push the tag to GitHub,
and the tests you configured pass a new image will be deposited in Docker Hub.

## Where can I can data to test my app

For both lightweight and full datasets to test your BIDS App, you can choose
from one of these
[example datasets](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/dataset_examples.html)

## Where should I describe changes between versions?

After tagging a new release it is important to provide a list of changes
on the GitHub Releases page.

It accepts markdown syntax and allows you to explain in detail what has changed.

Here's an [example](https://github.com/bids-apps/example/releases).

## Which container should I use to start building my app?

The only minimum requirements of a BIDS App's container is its ability to run
your pipeline. So for example, if your App is mostly Python based it should be
sufficient to start with any image that has Python and include your environment
dependencies.
