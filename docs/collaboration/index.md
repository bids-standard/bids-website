# Help make BIDS better!

BIDS is informed, supported, and guided by its users.
BIDS standards are intended to change and evolve as methods, resources,
and the needs of the BIDS community changes.
We encourage all researchers to contribute to the ongoing development of BIDS standards,
be it through discussion on websites, the creation of new BIDS tools,
or contributing to extending the BIDS specification through proposals.
Below is a list of common resources where users can get involved in making the BIDS standard better!

<u>Neurostars Website</u>

-   The easiest way to contribute to BIDS is to ask questions you have about the specification on
    [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org){:target="_blank"}.

-   If your question has a
    [bids tag](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids){:target="_blank"}
    it will be much easier for others to find the answer.

-   You can also get involved by _answering_ questions on
    [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids){:target="_blank"}!

<u>Github Issues</u>

-   You can contribute to the BIDS specification by opening
    [Issues](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues){:target="_blank"}
    and proposing changes via
    [Pull Requests](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pulls){:target="_blank"}
    on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification){:target="_blank"}.

-   To make improvements to the website that you are reading right now, you can also open an
    [Issue](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website/issues){:target="_blank"}
    and propose changes via Pull Requests at the
    [BIDS website GitHub repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website){:target="_blank"}.

<u> Become a part of the BIDS Community </u>

There are so many ways to help us build this community.

-   You could help someone else learn the benefits of BIDS by giving a talk in your local organization
-   Or you could work on [building a BIDS App](https://bids-website.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/bids-apps.html){:target="_blank"}!

<b>The only requirement is that everyone who contributes adheres to our [BIDS Code of Conduct](./bids_github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).</b>

Thank you for your contributions!

## Extending the BIDS specification

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and will evolve over time.
These are accomplished with BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs), which are community-driven processes.

Do you want to learn more about extending BIDS to a new modality or set of data types?
Read the [Guide](https://bids-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/)
and follow the [Submission Process](https://bids-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submission/).
