# Working groups

BIDS working groups are typically formed (but not limited to)
for the purpose of advancing the BIDS community, not the standard.

This could be a to set up and organize a local BIDS chapter,
to improve the documentation around BIDS...

## Forming a working group

The rules to form a working group are mentioned in the [governance](./governance.md#other-working-groups).

A template for the open-letter can be found in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JfTliUcpyRAGdiZSHObkvZFdkrxPTclQTvolr8ssNHM/edit).
