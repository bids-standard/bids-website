# Datasets

Here are some links to BIDS compliant data. Sourcedata (pre-BIDS) are sometimes
also available, these can be used to just see (or to build tutorials) of how
source data are converted to BIDS.

## BIDS examples with data files

[OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/):
If you're looking for full data files to run the validator on or simply compare to your own _bidsified_ data try searching here.
Datasets here are (by and large) publicly available and conform to BIDS.
