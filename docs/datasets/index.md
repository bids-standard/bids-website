# Datasets
BIDS compliant data can be found under many of the common neural data sharing
websites/databases. Below are some links to BIDS compliant data. Sourcedata (pre-BIDS)
are sometimes also available and these data can be used to test (or to build tutorials)
of how source data are converted to BIDS.

## Where to find BIDS datasets
Many public repositories for neuroimaging data are accepting (and in some cases requiring)
data submitted in BIDS format. Below is a small sample of some main resources for finding
BIDS datasets that may be used in your analyses.

[OpenNeuro][openneuro]:
If you're looking for full data files to run the validator on or simply compare to your
own _bidsified_ data try searching here. Datasets here are (by and large) publicly available and conform to BIDS.

[The NIMH Data Archive](https://nda.nih.gov/): The NIMH archive hosts many datasets and results
that follow BIDS naming structure. There isn't an easy search feature for finding BIDS data as of
yet, but larger datasets, such as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, provide
BIDS compliant data.

[NITRC](https://www.nitrc.org/xnat/index.php): the Neuroimaging Tools & Resources Collaboratory is another
resource for finding BIDS compliant datasets. The Neuroimaging Data Repository section provides
access to public datasets such as the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset.

## Brainhack Western 2018 dataset
These data, compiled at the Brainhack Western 2018 event can be used to test or create BIDS
apps. An example of sourcedata
[ds001](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15GiGHqit0gFFblOUuL2hSoWEJVw6q1M5)
(non-BIDS compliant NIfTi files) and raw data
[ds001_BIDS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A3TbarHbtXqx7FfW0UbWWuY1GflF3630) converted
to BIDS format are provided.

## Mother of unification studies

A 204-subject multimodal (MEG, MRI, fMRI) [dataset](https://doi.org/10.34973/37n0-yc51) to study language processing.

## BIDS examples with empty raw data files

[BIDS examples datasets](./examples.md) contain empty (example) raw data files
and can assist you in converting your own dataset into a BIDS compliant dataset,
or to run some tests with your code...
