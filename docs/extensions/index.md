A Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) Extension Proposal (BEP) is
a community-driven process to add a new modality or set of data types to
[the BIDS Specification][specification].

This site provides information about creating and working
with the BIDS Extension Proposal (commonly referred to as BEP or in the plural as BEPs).

## BEP Guide

For information about what is a BEP and how to get started working
with a BEP visit [the BEP Guide](./general-guidelines.md).

!!! warning

    Check [the specification][specification] and [the list of BEPs](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html#extending-the-bids-specification)
    before creating a new one. You may find existing or ongoing efforts
    that already support your use case.
    Avoid duplicating efforts.

## Submitting a BEP

Once you've made progress on your BEP and you are ready
to integrate it into the specification visit [the BEP Submission Guide](submission.md).

## The BIDS Schema

This site also serves as the main documentation repository for working with the BIDS Schema,
which you will need to enable validation of your BEP.
For more information about the history of, working with, and
translating your BEP into the schema visit [the Schema Guide](../standards/schema/index.md) on this site.
