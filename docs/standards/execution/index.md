# BIDS Apps execution specification

## The Problem

Neuroimaging is a field with an enormous library of powerful tools
and openly available datasets that can be difficult to get to work together.

## What is BIDS?

The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a community-driven
standardized data organization protocol that gives analysis tools a common
specification for data input, see this link. BIDS solves the dataset complexity
problem by providing a consistent representation for data sharing and adoption.

## So why do we need the BIDS Application Specification?

While BIDS is great for
standardizing datasets, analytical tools can take a variety of forms, arguments,
and complexities, limiting their ability to be applied interchangeably. The BIDS
Application Specification solves this problem by creating a community-driven
standardized structure for software definitions and their execution.
