# Outputs

## File formats for the application specification and report

BIDS Apps MUST be able to be called via the BIDS Application Boutiques descriptor
and corresponding input parameter dictionary files,
commonly referred to in the Boutiques parlance as "invocations", and accept any BIDS dataset.
It is RECOMMENDED that BIDS Applications produce BIDS-Derivatives-compliant datasets.

## Execution Report & Updating Dataset Description

When generated, an execution report that completely describes the processing
that was executed and the dataset MUST comply with the BIDS Provenance Extension Proposal (BEP28).
These outputs are OPTIONAL, and if provided, should be specified in the [`output-files`](./outputs.md) of the tool descriptor.

Similarly, the dataset_description.json file SHOULD be updated
to reflect the processing that has occurred by the BIDS Application.

## Behaviors

For a given set of arguments, the behavior of a BIDS Application
will typically vary based on the contents of the input dataset.
The dataset may be
BIDS-compliant, or it may not; and it may contain the file types the BIDS App requires, or it may not.
This section describes the expected behavior under each combination of cases,
and describes RECOMMENDED exit codes on systems that support them.

### Valid BIDS datasets

If the dataset is BIDS-compliant and contains the files required by the application,
then the application should make a best effort to perform its task to completion.

If the dataset is BIDS-compliant but does not contain the files required by the application,
then the application MAY fail immediately or when attempting to open a missing file.
In this case, it is RECOMMENDED to use exit code `66` (NOINPUT).

### Invalid BIDS datasets

If the dataset is not BIDS-compliant, then the BIDS App MAY fail immediately with exit code `16`.

If the dataset contains the required files but is not BIDS-compliant
(for example a "dirty" dataset that has more files than needed),
then the BIDS App MAY treat the dataset as valid.

### Exit codes

An exit code or [exit status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status)
is an integer indicating the reason for termination for use by the parent program or operating system.
The interpretation of exit codes varies across systems,
and programmers SHOULD follow the conventions of the systems for which they are programming.

Most operating systems, including POSIX (Linux, Mac OSX) and Windows use 0 to indicate success
and >0 to indicate failure.
POSIX systems are limited to an unsigned byte (range: 0-255),
so these recommendations are limited to that range.
Exit codes 64-78 are specified in BSD [sysexits(3)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysexits&sektion=3),
and should be avoided unless applicable.
Exit codes 2 and 126-165 may be set by [Bash](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html),
and so will be reserved.

The following exit codes are RECOMMENDED for consistent error handling under POSIX and Windows environments:
