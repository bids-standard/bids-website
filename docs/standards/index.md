# BIDS Standards

Neuroimaging experiments result in complex data that can be arranged in many different ways.
For a long time, there was no consensus how to organize and share
data obtained in neuroimaging experiments.
Even two researchers working in the same lab could opt to arrange their data in a different way.
Lack of consensus (or a standard) leads to misunderstandings and time wasted on rearranging data
or rewriting scripts expecting certain structure.

The current set of BIDS Standards provide outlines and guidance
for file and metaddata naming and organization, statistical modeling of neuroimaging data,
and applications created to be used with BIDS data.
These standards are intended to be updated and evolve as methods and data types change,
but current documentation on BIDS standards can be found in the sections below.

You can find further information for:
