# BIDS Apps execution specification

## The Problem

Neuroimaging is a field with an enormous library of powerful tools
and openly available datasets that can be difficult to get to work together.

## Why do we need the BIDS Application Specification?

While BIDS is great for standardizing datasets, analytical tools can take a variety of forms, arguments,
and complexities, limiting their ability to be applied interchangeably.
The BIDS Application Specification solves this problem
by creating a community-driven standardized structure for software definitions and their execution.
