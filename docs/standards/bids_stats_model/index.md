# The BIDS statistical model

The *BIDS Stats Models* describe how to fit *statistical models for neuroimaging data*
using *a machine-readable JSON document*.
Its purpose is prescriptive (as in a recipe),
rather than descriptive (as in summary of already fit models).

A *BIDS Stats Models* — in combination with a preprocessed BIDS dataset —
is sufficient to execute statistical models,
with minimal configuration and intervention required from the user.

The specification of BIDS Stats Models can be [browsed online](https://bids-standard.github.io/stats-models/).
