COLLABORATION

# Getting started

## BIDS Starter Kit
Read the [BIDS Starter Kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit){:target="_blank"} and check out the [tutorials](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/wiki/Tutorials){:target="_blank"} there.

## Learn from examples

You can find full datasets on [OpenNeuro.org](https://openneuro.org/public/datasets){:target="_blank"} and stripped down example datasets on [GitHub.org](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples){:target="_blank"}.

## Confused? Need help?

Post a question on [NeuroStars.org](https://neurostars.org/tags/bids){:target="_blank"} or on the [BIDS discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bids-discussion){:target="_blank"} email list.



# Get involved 

## Making BIDS better

The easiest way to contribute to BIDS is to ask questions you have about
the specification on [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org){:target="_blank"}. If your
question has a [bids tag](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids){:target="_blank"}
it will be much easier for others to find the answer.

You can also get involved by _answering_ questions on
[Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids){:target="_blank"}!

You can contribute to the BIDS specification by opening
[Issues](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues){:target="_blank"} and
propose changes via [Pull
Requests](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pulls){:target="_blank"} on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification){:target="_blank"}.

To make improvements to the website that you are reading right now, you
can also open an
[Issue](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website/issues){:target="_blank"} and
propose changes via [Pull
Requests](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website/pulls){:target="_blank"} at its
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website){:target="_blank"}.

There are so many ways to help us build this community.
You could help someone else learn the benefits of BIDS, give a talk in
your local organisation, or [build a BIDS
App](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/){:target="_blank"}!

The only requirement is that everyone who contributes adheres to our
[BIDS Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md){:target="_blank"}.

Thank you for your contributions!

## Extending the BIDS specification

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and will evolve over time. These are accomplished with BIDS Extension
Proposals (BEPs), which are community-driven processes.

Do you want to extend BIDS to a new modality or set of data types?
Please draft a BIDS Extension Proposal (BEP) following the [BIDS
Extension Proposals Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWmEEY-1-WuwBPNy5tDAxVJYQ9Een4hZJM06tQZg8X4){:target="_blank"}.

You can also contribute to ongoing BIDS Extension Proposals. [Here](LINK TO TABLE) there is a table of currently-active BEPs. The "Extension label" column provides a direct link to the documentation.

Please find our [latest BEP update](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10-zmgs6L0RBhiN-aLgRWCJT_fjrGi6LL5SgoeUvRbmU/edit#slide=id.p){:target:"_blank"}
presented in the [Open Science Room](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/){:target:"_blank"} at [OHBM](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3267&pageid=1){:target:"_blank"}.



# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [ffein@stanford.edu](mailto:ffein@stanford.edu). The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
