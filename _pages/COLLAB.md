COLLABORATION

# Getting started

## BIDS Starter Kit
Read the [BIDS Starter Kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit){:target="_blank"} and check out the [tutorials](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/wiki/Tutorials){:target="_blank"} there.

## Learn from examples

You can find full datasets on [OpenNeuro.org](https://openneuro.org/public/datasets){:target="_blank"} and stripped down example datasets on [GitHub.org](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples){:target="_blank"}.

## Confused? Need help?

Post a question on [NeuroStars.org](https://neurostars.org/tags/bids){:target="_blank"} or on the [BIDS discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bids-discussion){:target="_blank"} email list.



# Get involved 

## Making BIDS better

The easiest way to contribute to BIDS is to ask questions you have about
the specification on [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org){:target="_blank"}. If your
question has a [bids tag](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids){:target="_blank"}
it will be much easier for others to find the answer.

You can also get involved by _answering_ questions on
[Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids){:target="_blank"}!

You can contribute to the BIDS specification by opening
[Issues](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues){:target="_blank"} and
propose changes via [Pull
Requests](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pulls){:target="_blank"} on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification){:target="_blank"}.

To make improvements to the website that you are reading right now, you
can also open an
[Issue](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website/issues){:target="_blank"} and
propose changes via [Pull
Requests](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website/pulls){:target="_blank"} at its
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website){:target="_blank"}.

There are so many ways to help us build this community.
You could help someone else learn the benefits of BIDS, give a talk in
your local organisation, or [build a BIDS
App](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/){:target="_blank"}!

The only requirement is that everyone who contributes adheres to our
[BIDS Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md){:target="_blank"}.

Thank you for your contributions!

## Extending the BIDS specification

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and will evolve over time. These are accomplished with BIDS Extension
Proposals (BEPs), which are community-driven processes.

Do you want to extend BIDS to a new modality or set of data types?
Please draft a BIDS Extension Proposal (BEP) following the [BIDS
Extension Proposals Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWmEEY-1-WuwBPNy5tDAxVJYQ9Een4hZJM06tQZg8X4){:target="_blank"}.

You can also contribute to ongoing BIDS Extension Proposals. [Here](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/specs.html) there is a table of currently-active BEPs. The "Extension label" column provides a direct link to the documentation.

Please find our [latest BEP update](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10-zmgs6L0RBhiN-aLgRWCJT_fjrGi6LL5SgoeUvRbmU/edit#slide=id.p){:target:"_blank"}
presented in the [Open Science Room](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/){:target:"_blank"} at [OHBM](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3267&pageid=1){:target:"_blank"}.
