# The BIDS specification

The Brain Imaging Data Structure specification can be [browsed online](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/){:target="_blank"} or [downloaded as PDF](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3686061).

# BIDS Extension Proposals

To contribute a new BIDS Extension Proposal (BEP) see [guidelinessection](LINK TO COLLAB/Extending the BIDS specification section).

Note that all of the extension ideas that are not backwards compatible and thus will have to wait for BIDS 2.0 are listed

### Completed BEPs

When an extension reaches maturity it is merged into the main body of
the specification.  Below is a table of BEPs that have been merged in
the main body of the specification.

| Extension label                                                 | Title                                      | Moderators/leads                                  |

Some proposals that set out to extend the BIDS specification have instead become tools for handling BIDS. See the table below.
