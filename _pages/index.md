# About BIDS

Neuroimaging experiments result in complicated data that can be arranged in many different ways.
So far there is no consensus how to organize and share data obtained in neuroimaging experiments.
Even two researchers working in the same lab can opt to arrange their data in a different way.
Lack of consensus (or a standard) leads to misunderstandings and time wasted on rearranging data or rewriting scripts expecting certain structure.
With the Brain  Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), we describe a simple and easy to adopt way of organizing neuroimaging and behavioral data.

BIDS was heavily inspired by the format used internally by the OpenfMRI repository that is now known as [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org){:target="_blank"}.
While working on BIDS we consulted many neuroscientists to make sure it covers most common experiments, but at the same time is intuitive and easy to adopt.
The specification is intentionally based on simple file formats and folder structures to reflect current lab practices and make it accessible to a wide range of scientists coming from different backgrounds.

## BIDS is a community effort

BIDS is developed by the community for the community and everybody can [become a part of the community](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html).

## Specification vs. Ecosystem

Since the inception of the BIDS specification that documents how to organize neuroimaging data, a large ecosystem of tools and resources has evolved around BIDS.

A few of the key elements of this ecosystem are the [BIDS-validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator){:target="_blank"}, to automatically check datasets for adherence to the specification, [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/){:target="_blank"}, as a database for BIDS formatted datasets, and [BIDS-Apps](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005209){:target="_blank"}, a collection of portable neuroimaging pipelines that understand BIDS datasets.

A non-exhaustive list of further tools can be found in the [Benefits](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/benefits.html) section.

With the ongoing development of new tools and resources it is important to keep in mind that the BIDS specification remains the standard according to which the entire ecosystem must adhere.
