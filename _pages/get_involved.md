# Get involved in making BIDS better

The easiest way to contribute to BIDS is to ask questions you have about
the specification on [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org.) If your
question has a [bids tag](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids)
it will be much easier for others to find the answer.

You can also get involved by _answering_ questions on
[Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids)!

You can contribute to the BIDS specification by opening
[Issues](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues) and
propose changes via [Pull
Requests](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pulls) on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification).

To make improvements to the website that you are reading right now, you
can also open an
[Issue](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website/issues) and
propose changes via [Pull
Requests](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website/pulls) at its
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website).

There are so many ways to help us build this community.
You could help someone else learn the benefits of BIDS, give a talk in
your local organisation, or [build a BIDS
App](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/)!

The only requirement is that everyone who contributes adheres to our
[BIDS Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct).

Thank you for your contributions!

## Extending the BIDS specification

The BIDS specification can be extended in a backwards compatible way and
will evolve over time. These are accomplished with BIDS Extension
Proposals (BEPs), which are community-driven processes.

Do you want to extend BIDS to a new modality or set of data types?
Please draft a BIDS Extension Proposal (BEP) following the [BIDS
Extension Proposals
Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWmEEY-1-WuwBPNy5tDAxVJYQ9Een4hZJM06tQZg8X4).  

You can also contribute to ongoing BIDS Extension Proposals. Below is a
table of currently-active BEPs. The "Extension label" column provides a
direct link to the documentation.

When an extension reaches maturity it is merged into the main body of
the specification.  Below is a table of BEPs that have been merged in
the main body of the specification.

All of the extension ideas that are not backwards compatible and thus
will have to wait for BIDS 2.0 are listed
