BIDS is a community effort
[//]: # (BIG FONT)

The BIDS organization is a community of brain researchers that strives for consensus decision making. The BIDS organization primarily produces the BIDS-Specification along with supporting BIDS-aware tools and community. Our organizational design works in tandem with our governance structure to describe the BIDS environment, and it is based on three pillars: 

1) **Standard**: related to the BIDS Specification and BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs); 
2) **Tools**: BIDS Apps and BIDS-aware software; and 
3) **Collaboration**: BIDS community. 
Our organizational design is driven by three principles: Sustainability, Robustness, and Inclusivity. See more at: [BIDSOrganization](LINK).


# Governance and Decision Making

To achieve the goals of widespread adoption of the standard while growing to adapt to its community of members, BIDS is led by a series of groups presented below. See more at: [BIDSGovernance](LINK).
