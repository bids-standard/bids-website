# NOTE: ONLY COMPLETED BEPs ARE INCLUDED IN THIS LIST
#       SEE: https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html#completed-beps
#
#       FURTHERMORE, THE LEADS LISTED HERE NEED NOT HAVE BEEN THE ORIGINAL BEP LEADS.
#       RATHER, THEY MAY BE REPLACEMENTS OF THE ORIGINAL BEP LEADS WHO DID NO LONGER
#       WANT TO BE PART OF THE BIDS ADVISORY GROUP.
