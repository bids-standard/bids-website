     “Thanks for this - hopefully we all agree that using BIDS is a good idea where practical, and should be encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
     The best thing would be for BIDS (committee etc) to encourage authors to be very clear and explicit (eg in Methods text) when BIDS has been used, just as with the many other important aspects of the methodology used in a given paper. At Imaging Neuroscience we would have no problem at all in authors being clear about their use of BIDS. We couldn't have a "front page badge" because that would risk an overwhelming number of similar requests, but I think the important thing is to explicitly mention use of BIDS in the main text.

## NOTES

### Derivatives output - internal review before release

-   Wanting to change the atlas BEP - this is more of a space we use to
    segment different tissues.

-   Suggestion to change the "Atlas" naming to "Parcellation"

    -   Do we need to introduce a new term? We could stick with p-seg
        (probabilistic) and d-seg (deterministic)

-   Should we add this Derivatives output to the website?

    -   Where should it go? Create a PR or multiple PRs?

-   Suggestion: integrate the BIDS derivatives guidelines piecemeal into
    the BID general derivatives spec

    -   Maybe not the BEPs table info - table could go to the BIDs
        extensions

### Imaging Neuroscience Response regarding BIDS 'badge'

-   Turn the conversation around

    -   Example: include a checklist (or guidelines) for reviewers to
        ensure BIDS is compliant

    -   Ask for how the BIDS community/steering co. can be helpful to
        improve BIDS review process

    -   This could be comparable to Nature's code review

-   Ariel will reply to Steve Smith with this suggestion

    -   Suggestions: If Imaging neuroscience is amenable, then we could
        also post the guidelines on the BIDS website for wider use and
        adoption of these reviewer guidelines.

### BIDS impact

Zotero collection for tracking BIDS related publications, BEPs, etc:
[[https://www.zotero.org/groups/5111637/bids]{.underline}](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5111637/bids)

The BIDS grant writing kit could be updated

There is also a github for this:
[[https://github.com/Remi-Gau/bids\_citations/blob/main/dashboard.md]{.underline}](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/bids_citations/blob/main/dashboard.md)

This info should also be displayed on the BIDS.io website

This should be included in the BIDS github as well.

Overall great feedback for this initial draft -

Suggested to include grant writing boilerplate info about BIDS stats

Add rationale at the beginning of both the [[BIDS grant writing
kit]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q7JTOvUqt05YQfnbvGoP1SZQy_CGkNEVcsVZeS4D5_o/edit#heading=h.pb4yuopfe1pt)
and [[Remi's github
dashboard]{.underline}](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/bids_citations/blob/main/dashboard.md)

Is the BIDS granting writing kit meant to support building the BIDS
community or for users to mention BIDS in their grants.

Where can we document the various grants that have been inspired by
BIDS? Can we also include a link to the funding proposal\
Google Analytics on [[Grant writing
kit]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q7JTOvUqt05YQfnbvGoP1SZQy_CGkNEVcsVZeS4D5_o/edit)
need to be updated:

For visualizing our metrics, we have put together 2 dashboards:

1.  [the website](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/eab164ba-9f98-46e8-bee8-1f4f5328dc6e/page/V5leB)

2.  [the specification](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ 57bf46f1-034c-4d8b-9fe2-3a2243e469c5/page/w1leB)

Ask BEP025 for update on BIDS website?

Have a run of show for the OHBM Open Science Room BIDS Town Hall (Eric
to take this topic to maintainers)
