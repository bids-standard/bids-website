# Steering Group executive summary, action items, and minutes

Date: Thursday February 13, 2020
Attended: Franklin Feingold, Melanie Ganz, Guiomar Niso, Robert Oostenveld, Kirstie Whitaker

### Executive Summary

We discussed the channels through which to share updates to the BIDS specification.
An issue was opened to start crowdsourcing and collecting this information.
We will be using this to share the release of v1.2.2 and to request the final rounds of feedback on the Genetic information extension.

We discussed generating an example slide deck that  community members can  use (or pick from) when they want to present BIDS.

We discussed considerations for when to open a repository under the BIDS standard organization on GitHub.
There should be multiple people committed to the repository (otherwise it is better of under the personal GitHub account), the maintainers should be clearly identifiable (e.g. as a CODEOWNERS file at top level), there should be a code of conduct in the repo that is consistent with that of the BIDS specification, and (as a consequence of the code of conduct) the repository should welcome contributions from others.

We want to host another community forum (but not too frequent) and potentially a starter kit/demo in the Open Science Room at OHBM.

Regarding issue [#407](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/407), we consider Zenodo to be a suitable  the location to store historical specification pdfs, also for future versions.
