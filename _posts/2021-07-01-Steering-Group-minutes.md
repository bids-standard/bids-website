     From the governing structure:
    </p>
    <p>
     Initially, Steering Group members will be elected for staggered terms of 2/3/4 years, to allow continuity and overlap across years. This will ensure institutional knowledge is preserved within the BIDS Steering Group. In the initial BIDS Steering Group, there will be at least one non-MRI modality represented. -&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
     One person drops after 1 year, 2 more after 2 and 2 more after 4.

## Executive summary

After a discussion we decided that Kirstie will rotate out now, but then
Russ should probably rotate out next, maybe together with Melanie, to
ensure the balance of the remaining members. This way it's very likely
that we can keep an MRI representative in the steering group which is a
requirement.

Wrt election proceedings we may have people put up a 200 word criteria
on how they complement the current steering group in terms of e.g.
modality, gender, geographic location, seniority, etc. Maybe add this to
the governance document by adding something regarding not only ensuring
diversity wrt modality but also diversity.

Regarding resilience wrt Franklin\'s maintainer job, since he needs to
step out a bit, maybe we can together with the empty steering group slot
advertise for two more communication type of maintainers. Robert
suggests to maybe reach out and go for people to spend their PhD duty
hours on for example being BIDS maintainer. Kirstie proposes writing up
a clear role description, accompanied with suggestions on how to justify
time to supervisors. Promote to the broader community before relying on
steering committee to find maintainers.
