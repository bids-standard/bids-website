## Notes

**Present:** Robert Oostenveld, Guiomar Niso, Eric Earl (visiting
maintainer), Yaroslav Halchenko, Kim Ray

**Guest: invite Chris Rorden**

**NOTES from Chris Rorden:**

BEPs are done by experts, but implementations are not done by experts

BEPs document examples, but are not clear enough in implementation
details (to entry level users).\
Shows unit testing for converting/translating metadata, requires test
datasets and correct outputs

Terminology differs e.g. between Siemens and Philips

-   PET example where dicom standards were not used for BIDS

-   [http://www.oneukrainian.com/tmp/DICOMfields.txt](http://www.oneukrainian.com/tmp/DICOMfields.txt)
    has rough grep for descriptions of DICOMs fields matching. Some
    match some not.

Suggests possibly reaching out to the tool experts/manufacturers to
better implement BEPs from start to end.

-   Liaisons have been responsive on neurostars (Phillip Clinical
    Scientists UK Matthew Clemence \[github drmclem\] Mayo Sandeep
    Ganji \[github sandeepganji\])

We have a statement to align BIDS with current standards and
vocabularies

-   Yarik could not locate it...

SOLUTION:

We cannot assume dcm2nii will fix all of our data conversions.

Reach out to developers for more input on BEPs before they are approved

Provide empty header files for examples of data

-   Would be great to have example datasets with sourcedata/ and code/
    and README.md provided to describe HOW data was
    converted/translated

Additional expectations for BEPS before they are approved

-   advise each BEP to reach out to manufacturers to make them aware of
    the standardization ongoing, see the BEP, possibly provide
    feedback and even may be align metadata/terminology

Consider/formalize a common principle to choose DICOM fields naming in
favor of adding new names.
