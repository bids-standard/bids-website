# Steering Group executive summary, action items, and minutes

Date: Thursday October 22, 2020

<!--more-->

### Executive Summary

We began the meeting by converging on the plan for merging in the [PET BEP](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/633){:target="_blank"}. We touched upon the [recognizing credit on manuscripts](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/627){:target="_blank"} conversation. This will be returned to next meeting.

The majority of the meeting we were joined by Jon Cohen and Tal Yarkoni of the Model Description Framework project. The Model Description Framework seeks to develop a common modeling format to describe a computational model. The goal is to enhance the reproducibility and disseminability of computational models. This will also improve the accessibility to more complex and sophisticated models.

### Action items

| Action items |
| -------- |
| Look further into corporate authorship |

### Minutes

- Agreed upon PET schedule for community review
- Revisited authorship discussion
  - Collection entity with entire membership included in the single entity
  - Perhaps 1 representative from each group
  - Set procedure to get sign off from each group
  - Corporate authorship?

We were joined by Jon Cohen and Tal Yarkoni to discuss their Model Description Framework project
- Primarily focused computational models
- The idea is to have a common format to describe a model
- Enhance reproducibility and disseminability
- Models could be represented at json objects
- MDF team will be interested to survey the BIDS community (in the future)
- Wants to provide access to more complex and sophisticated models
- Utilize open data with open models -> Reproducibility
- No domain specificity - driven by use cases
- Reaching out to clinicians
  - Computational psychiatry
  - Basic sciences -> Clinical sciences mapping
- Experiment standardization
  - Mapping the imaging context with the modeling parameters
  - Perhaps a BEP can address
