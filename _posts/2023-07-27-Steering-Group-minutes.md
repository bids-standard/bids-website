     “Thanks for this - hopefully we all agree that using BIDS is a good idea where practical, and should be encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
     The best thing would be for BIDS (committee etc) to encourage authors to be very clear and explicit (eg in Methods text) when BIDS has been used, just as with the many other important aspects of the methodology used in a given paper. At Imaging Neuroscience we would have no problem at all in authors being clear about their use of BIDS. We couldn't have a "front page badge" because that would risk an overwhelming number of similar requests, but I think the important thing is to explicitly mention use of BIDS in the main text."

## NOTES

### BIDS Badges

-   Ariel will follow up with Guy Jones

-   Others to reach out to:

    -   Renzo Huber @ Aperture - and how can BIDS help Aperture? - Kim will invite them for Sept 7th meeting

    -   [Neurolibre](https://github.com/neurolibre/neurolibre) to add a BIDS tag?

### BIDS Derivatives

-   It\'s currently summer holiday so it may not be a good time to
    expect feedback, can review next meeting.

### Feedback from OHBM

-   After townhall, maintainers meeting expressed excitement about the
    derivatives meeting. More in-person meet-ups might encourage more
    progress on various projects

    -   Winter/Spring might be a good timeframe for the next meeting.

    -   Could existing funded projects help with this? - perhaps look
        into a supplement for the BIDS connectivity grant?

    -   Adam Thomas at NIMH might have ideas for funding opportunities

    -   NSF-POSE funding possibility?

-   DICOM/BIDS discussion around the townhall (ISMRM-RD group might be a good collaborative group to work with for DICOM/BIDS interoperability).

### BIDS 2.0 : (also feedback from the town hall)

-   *Aka BIDS 1.0 with enhancements*

-   How can we take advantage of ontologies in this version?

-   How can new enhancements allow more flexibility for BIDS? E.g. use of dashes in file names

-   Work on the schema may facilitate or inhibit the transition to BIDS 2.0

-   How/When do we know when BIDS 2.0 is ready?

-   Anthony says that the [[schema is
    complete]{.underline}](https://imgflip.com/i/7txwm7)

-   New BIDS issue for BIDS 2.0 specification & [project board](https://github.com/orgs/bids-standard/projects/10/views/1?layout=board).

### Neuro Open Science Prize

[Neuro Open Science Prize](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/open-science/open-science-awards-and-prizes/neuro-irv-and-helga-cooper-foundation-open-science-prizes)

-   Submissions open August 1st, Due Date Sept 10, 2023

-   Should assemble previous applications

-   Organize letter of support for the application (need at least 10 letters) :

    -   [Brainstorm for letters here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gYfP1C84e1_81HPIGBbXl8v_Z3b43uCLGHBa0RhtnOM/edit#gid=0)

    -   Possible contacts:
        [https://www.internationalbraininitiative.org/data-standards-and-sharing-working-group](https://www.internationalbraininitiative.org/data-standards-and-sharing-working-group)

-   How should the application strategy change from previous years?
