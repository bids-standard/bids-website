# BIDS version 1.9.0

We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.9.0 of the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)!

The main addition of this release is the inclusion of BIDS extension proposal (BEP) 029 to support [motion data](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modality-specific-files/motion.html).

BIDS-Motion makes motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. It supports various types of motion capture systems including motion tracking in virtual space.

We would like to thank contributors to this BEP, led by Sein Jeung and Julius Welzel with significant contributions from Helena Cockx and others.

Check out the [preprint associated with this BEP](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/w6z79/).

Example datasets for motion data can be found on our [BIDS example repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples):
- [motion_dualtask](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples/tree/master/motion_dualtask)
- [motion_spotrotation](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples/tree/master/motion_spotrotation)
- [motion_systemvalidation](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples/tree/master/motion_systemvalidation)

Motion datasets can already be validated with [the BIDS validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator) and queried with libraries like [pybids](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids) or [bids-matlab](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab).

The latest version of [the BIDS schema]((https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/schema.json)) that includes this extension can be easily interacted with the [bidsschematools python package](https://pypi.org/project/bidsschematools/).
