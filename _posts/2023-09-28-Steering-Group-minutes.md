**Present:** Cyril Pernet, Ariel Rokem, Chris Markiewicz, Robert
Oostenveld, Guiomar Niso, Yaroslav Halchenko

**Guest:**


Meeting Notes:

**Kim's Maternity leave through the end of the year**

Remaining 2023 agendas are listed in the steering group

Sign up sheet is
[[here]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ys52kgOebRxGPYSvowTcmaZhph8rZ0_kflFQ6jtRUU4/edit#gid=0)
for assuming Kim's role in meeting management: Guiomar, Robert and Ariel
take turns at the next three meetings. We won't meet on 21 Dec.

**Meeting schedule:**

-   December 21st. NO MEETING - Kim will remove agenda and calendar.

**Open science Prize:**

-   Application is complete!

-   Ariel will update the letters of support in the BIDS drive along
    with the other application materials

**OHBM content call:**

-   We should submit a round table request for the BIDS townhall
    meeting - Cyril will submit this

-   Or should this be part of the Symposium for BIDS?

**Aperture:**

-   Kim will follow up on any updates from the Aperture committee

**NSF POSE Q1 2024:**

-   Ariel's proposal has been funded, there will be an open source
    software meeting that will happen as a result of this funding. More
    information to come

**BIDS Maintainers Meeting**

-   April 10-12, 2023 - maintainers has indicated that this is an ideal
    timeframe for them

-   NSF will only fund within US travel under this mechanism - non-US
    maintainers will need to find funding to travel US and then the NSF
    grant can pay for their travel within the US.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **NSF can support travel to the meeting**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Are there non-US projects funding BIDS?

    -   Cyril -

-   Can BIDS connectivity project (Franco Pestilli?) support Peer's
    travel?

-   Will non-maintainers also attend?

    -   Maintainers may identify additional attendees

    -   BEP leads that are ready to be merged may be ideal additional
        attendees

-   Ariel will attend a maintainers meeting next week to help plan
    further.

**BIDS-Prov BEP028** (Camille's email Prov)

-   Is their BEP ready to be merged? What are the next steps?

-   This BEP will likely not be merged directly into the BIDS validator;
    the validator could call to this BEP similar to how it is done for
    PET data.

-   Maintainers will work with Camille to determine how to implement the
    BIDS-Prov BEP

**BIDS Spatial Derivatives**

-   Proposal seems to be converging, there needs to be a vote on how to
    move forward

-   Meant to curb the explosion of Suffixes in file naming

-   Next steps: PR to BIDS extensions site for guidance that gets
    up/down voted?

    -   End discussion period, Allow two weeks for a voting period

**Next Meeting Guest?**

-   Any BIDS leads?

-   Robert will invite the leads of the NIBS BEP (non invasive brain
    stimulation,
    [[BEP037]{.underline}](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/bep037)) to ask
    whether they want to attend the next or next-next BIDS meeting.

**More generally: BIDS advisory group (i.e., BEP leads) engagement**

-   Start meetings with BEP leads and SG

-   BIDS Townhall format? Additional meeting with lead for discussing
