# Steering Group executive summary, action items, and minutes

Date: Thursday July 9, 2020

<!--more-->

### Executive Summary

We were joined by Franco Pestilli to discuss his potential BIDS grant. We went over the scope of his grant and how he intends to frame it. Through this process, we realized there were potential overlaps with other community initiatives and discussed a way to better organize the efforts. We want a mechanism that can capture BIDS grant writing initiatives so we may better support them. This can be in the form of a grant writing kit.
