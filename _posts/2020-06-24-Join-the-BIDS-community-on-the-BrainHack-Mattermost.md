# Join the BIDS community on the BrainHack Mattermost

BIDS is joining the [BrainHack Mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/){:target:"_blank"}!

<!--more-->

We are proud to announce our home for hosting BIDS organization instant messaging: the [BrainHack Mattermost platform](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/){:target:"_blank"}! We have listed below our current set of BIDS channels. We will be establishing several BIDS channels related to: BEP development, community discussions, and more! Check it out and create your own channel! Please be sure the channel name contains `bids` in the title to increase findability.

[Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/){:target:"_blank"} is an open-source alternative to Slack. The user interface and experience is very similar to that on Slack. One may join a channel, make a channel, or private message.

To find our `BIDS` channels, please navigate to Mattermost and click `More...` at the bottom of the `PUBLIC CHANNELS` section. A prompt will pop up enabling you to search for our `BIDS` related channels. If you have any issues, please email Franklin at <ffein@stanford.edu>

The [BrainHack project](https://www.brainhack.org/){:target:"_blank"} seeks to bridge the neuroscience and data science communities through hackathons and unconferences. To do this, they convene unique conferences comprised of researchers from around the world with diverse backgrounds and interests to develop our next generation of open source software for neuroscience. These workshops consist of educational activities, along with plenty of development time. If you are interested in learning more please visit [their website](https://www.brainhack.org/){:target:"_blank"}, check out [their paper](https://academic-oup-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/gigascience/article/5/1/s13742-016-0121-x/2720978){:target:"_blank"}, and take a look at a [step by step guide](https://thewinnower.com/papers/5577-a-step-by-step-guide-for-organizing-open-collaborative-brainhack-events){:target:"_blank"} for organizing a BrainHack yourself. 

We look forward to seeing you on Mattermost!
