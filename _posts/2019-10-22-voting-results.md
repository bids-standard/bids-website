Our winning slate represents multiple imaging modalities (MRI, MEG, EEG, iEEG, and PET) from around the world with several differing perspectives and expertise. The group members have been influential in pushing the BIDS Initiative initially and in extending BIDS into more imaging modalities. Their wealth of expertise will push BIDS forward into the derivative space, integrating across the modalities, sharing tools and apps, with a focus on reproducibility in the long-term. To learn more about this group please visit their [description page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mv_fOjeQbpAu6fVPKnTerXp-it6F59wi/view). We have also shared the [voter data and code](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbids-standard%2Fbids-specification%2Fwiki%2FBIDS-Steering-Group-Election-data&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEht6bBbCvP44DfJX7u041qja9KFg) used to determine the results.
