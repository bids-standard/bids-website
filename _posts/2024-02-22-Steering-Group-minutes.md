## BIDS Meeting Notes

### Plan for website

-   Eric is chairing the BIDS Online Presence Working Group

    -   Eric owes the open letter to the Steering Group

-   May use google season of docs (need to sign up for the program,
    starts April 2nd for applications)

    -   Will reach out to INCF to reconnect as the admin for google
        season of docs

    -   Mentors identified: Eric, Christine, and Remi (outlined in doc
        linked in agenda)

-   Eric will reach out to the group to schedule a follow up meeting.

-   Yaroslav reminded the group that he has \$5k CAD to compensate for
    work on this project

BEP39 for dimensionality reduction-based networks

[[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SLvZ7um3RQAiDr6KeK8eO_mNoQ0qHl_bzx_gqIS169Y/edit#slide=id.g152266b1f78_0_45]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SLvZ7um3RQAiDr6KeK8eO_mNoQ0qHl_bzx_gqIS169Y/edit#slide=id.g152266b1f78_0_45)

-   May need to introduce new terminology (something akin to an
    \'index', param-mixing, param-components, something akin to
    \'model')

    -   Eric suggests instead of \'index' potentially like
        [[\*\_aslcontext.tsv]{.underline}](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendices/arterial-spin-labeling.html#_aslcontexttsv-three-possible-cases)

        -   [[https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendices/arterial-spin-labeling.html#\_aslcontexttsv-three-possible-cases]{.underline}](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendices/arterial-spin-labeling.html#_aslcontexttsv-three-possible-cases)

    -   \<modality\>map : discussion determined *modality* is a suffix

        -   Related discussion
            [[https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-2-devel/issues/58#issuecomment-1711758273]{.underline}](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-2-devel/issues/58#issuecomment-1711758273)

    -   \'model-ICA_description.json' : suggestion to rename file as
        \'dataset_dscription.json' and include \'DatasetType: model" and
        model-ICA_mfp.json similarly to \'task-xxx_bold.json

-   Current state is to build up and extend \'spatiotemporal
    decompositions' introduced in BEP 012

-   Interoperability : BIDS-Prov

    -   [[https://github.com/bids-standard/BEP028_BIDSprov/blob/master/examples/from_parsers/spm/spm_default_batch.jsonld#L65-L77]{.underline}](https://github.com/bids-standard/BEP028_BIDSprov/blob/master/examples/from_parsers/spm/spm_default_batch.jsonld#L65-L77)

    -   Software parameters is similar to BIDS-prov's Parameters
        description (what is the specific file?)

### Stalled BEPS

Should there be a mechanism for addressing conflicts that halt BEP
progress?

Suggestion: 1. a voting system similar to how the steering group is
elected.

How would we want to implement something like this while addressing
concerns of FAIRness?

2\. BEP leader determines how to move forward.

**3. Could a technical committee make these decisions? (maintainers +
steering group) - if there is quorum possibility to vote one way or the
other**

When do we modify the schema to address new ideas?

### DICOM

### BIDS 2.0

### BEP guidelines updating
