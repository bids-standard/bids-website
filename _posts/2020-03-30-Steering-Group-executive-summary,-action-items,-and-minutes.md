# Steering Group executive summary, action items, and minutes

Date: Monday March 23, 2020

<!--more-->

### Executive Summary

We discussed how to move forward with implementing the author lists on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3686062){:target="_blank"} from our pdf specification. We want to provide guidance on how we landed on our decision: a single author “BIDS Contributing Group”. This will be opened as a proposal with a request for comments (RFC) on the [BIDS-Specification repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification){:target="_blank"}. This is important to deploy with the community’s approval. This may give way for a stronger contributor tracking system.

We clarified the format and points for the monthly Maintainers update. This should be less than 1 page and keep a high level view of BIDS. The executive summary must include: achievements, struggles, next month aims, blockers or steering group help. The update may also link to issues with a 1 sentence narrative. Keeping in mind the purpose of the update from the Steering Group’s perspective: knowing the hard parts or blockers and capture the work needed to maintain BIDS.

We invited the [ASL BEP](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/bep005){:target="_blank"} leads to the next Steering Group meeting.

    - The blocking items may be most important for Steering Group to be aware of.
    - Link to the issues on GitHub
