# Steering Group executive summary, action items, and minutes

Date: Thursday December 3, 2020

<!--more-->

### Executive Summary

This was a joint meeting between the Steering and Maintainers Group. We began this meeting by discussing the status of the [ASL BEP](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/669){:target="_blank"}. This BEP has completed the community review and the Maintainers are preparing to incorporate the extension into the standard. We found large portions of [BEP001](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pulls?q=is%3Apr+bep001){:target="_blank"} will also go into the next release. We spent the majority of our meeting discussing how we can provide guidance to BEP leads regarding [crediting the Steering and Maintainers group](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/627){:target="_blank"}. We evaluated several different potential approaches.

### Minutes

- [ASL BEP](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/669){:target="_blank"} and next release:
  - Whether to merge ASL BEP before holidays will be left up to Maintainers.
  - Releasing ASL and most of BEP001
- Crediting:
  - Maintainership counts as "substantial contributions to the conception of the work" (one of [ICMJE](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html){:target="_blank"} criteria).
  - Look at [https://credit.niso.org/](https://credit.niso.org/){:target="_blank"} for authorship roles
    - Roles that are applicable: data curation and software
    - Resources potentially too
  - Include recommended (but not required) text for including Steering/Maintainers as coauthors and description of roles. Requiring credit goes against open values of standard.
    - Split Steering group and Maintainer group descriptions/recommendations given different levels of engagement.
    - Generally will be Steering Group + Maintainers or just Maintainers.
  - Add columns to Maintainers table with start date and end date, and self-selection on whether to include on papers if authors think the ex-Maintainer contributed.
  - Authorship credit could be equal among our groups. BEP leads can make the decision.
  - Preference may be a BIDS Maintainers consortia author
    - [Credit taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/){:target="_blank"} could address and report specific contributions
  - To help avoid confusion regarding how to add a corporate author, we may provide a few examples of how it can be done
