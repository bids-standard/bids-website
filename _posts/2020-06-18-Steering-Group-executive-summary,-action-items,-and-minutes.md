# Steering Group executive summary, action items, and minutes

Date: Thursday June 18, 2020

<!--more-->

### Executive Summary

We discussed and decided on utilizing the [BrainHack Mattermost platform](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/){:target="_blank"} for our instant messaging solution. This fits nicely into where our community has been informally organized.

We went over our BIDS presentations occurring in the [Open Science Room](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/schedule/){:target="_blank"} at [OHBM](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3885){:target="_blank"}. We are sharing on the website [all the BIDS presentations and posters](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/2020/06/19/BIDS-OHBM-OSR-2020.html){:target="_blank"} happening at OHBM. There are many BIDS-aware tools being developed, but an emphasis should be put on generating the associated documentation.
