## Join the first BIDS Community Forum events in January 2020

The [BIDS Steering Group]({% post_url 2019-12-31-meet-the-bids-steering-group %}) are excited to announce two **Community Forums**!

Inspired by [town hall meetings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall_meeting) and the OHBM General Assembly and Feedback Forum, these online events are a space for members of the BIDS community to meet the steering group and to discuss BIDS strategy and vision.

UPDATE: We have shared recordings of the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBG1kl6iJeE&t=6s) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23OySb5kbtM) Community Forum meetings.

You can ask questions in real time during one of the calls, or send us your questions in advance at [this google form](https://forms.gle/uLtkbnZbKZwxPb2w8).

The steering group might have answers for some of the questions, but our focus during the two calls will be to listen to the needs and priorities of the BIDS community.
If these events go well, we'll aim to repeat them on a regular basis through the year.
