            BIDScoin is a flexible tool to convert (“coin”) source-level (raw) neuroimaging
            data sets to BIDS without needing to code anything. It features automatic
            data discovery based on header as well as filesystem information, and comes with
            a user-friendly GUI to add missing information and tweak the results. BIDScoin
            supports multiple source data formats with plugins (e.g. employing dcm2niix,
            spec2nii or nibabel) and allows customization of the prior knowledge about your
            data (allowing for fully automatic CLI data conversion if you like).

            The BIDSconvertR R package provides a user-friendly workflow with graphical user interfaces.
            It consists of the following steps:
            (i) convert DICOM data to NIfTI data using dcm2niix
            (ii) structure this data according to the BIDS specification
            (iii) provide the papayaWidget viewer for inspecting the images

            (1) No installation or programming requirements.
            (2) Handling of both imaging and task events data and metadata.
            (3) Semi-automated inference and guidance for adherence to BIDS.
            (4) Multiple data management options, including download BIDS data
            to local system, or transfer to OpenNeuro.org or to brainlife.io.

            A containerized app that can be used to perform BIDS conversion of
            DICOM studies sent directly to mercure from a scanner or PACS. mercure
            is an open-source DICOM orchestration platform that can integrate
            containerized apps into clinical workflows. It has a graphical user
            interface making it easy to setup and manage BIDS configurations for
            multiple protocols. The Dcm2Bids tool is used for conversion.
